**Flair**

When you post please assign flair to your post, especially if you have an account or a story which may trigger some people looking for support.  Thank you!

**Reason for this sub**

It had come to my attention that a lot of news about the epidemic had been causing spikes in anxiety and problems with people's mental health, which really exacerbates the problem.

And with more and more cities going into in lockdown and more people forcing quarantines it seems that mental health is CRITICAL at this point in time. So hence comes this sub.

2,Seeing my friends with long haul post-COVID symptoms has destroyed my mental health.,119,hptkhv,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hptkhv/seeing_my_friends_with_long_haul_postcovid/,16,"Hey all,

I am a contact tracer working on the COVID19 response in my region. It's been an honor to help people through this tough time.

I have two friends who could be considered COVID ""long haulers"" who still have random symptoms pop up every now and again. One of my friends is still experiencing some pain here and there *five months after getting the ""all-clear"". Nothing debilitating, but it's there. She's been able to go for hikes and whatnot, so she's mostly back to normal. Another friend is dealing with the symptoms of fatigue. Hearing others have their strength completely sapped from them is causing me a mix of grief and rage.

I talk to one of my long hauler friends the other day. She said what I was experiencing sounded like survivor's grief. I have asthma, and I'm certain that if I ever contract it, I'd be in the same boat. I'm just angry that our government failed us. I'm grieving how this didn't have to happen. I'm worried about the possible long-term effects of this illness. I don't want any more of my friends to die. 

Help. Please. I need to know that they're going to be okay.",2020-07-12 16:23:05

4,School Anxiety,13,hprqte,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hprqte/school_anxiety/,2,"Schools open back for the fall semester about a month from now. Like many of you, I'm terrified and pissed. Not only due to this pandemic, but also the imcompetence of the leaders we in the U.S. elected. I have two sisters in elementary and middle school. Their mask policy is ""encouraged"", but not required. I honestly doubt social distancing is possible for children. Moreover, the county has stated no way of enforcing these policies. My sister in middle school has high fucntioning autism. My family tried to put a mask on her, but she keeps taking/ripping it off. I doubt she'll wear a face shield. I'm going to college for my 1st year, and even though USG schools have made mask a requirment; after THREE months, they haven't stated how they'll enforce it. Reopening for the fall semester just seems like survival of the fittest. All I can do is hope they can make it. For any of you going back to school, how do you cope with this state of panic ?

She won't listen to me. She doesn't \*really\* need the money because her husband is still working (social distant and safe) and they own their house outright.   But she insists that it's more important to keep her clients than to remain safe during a pandemic. Obviously, because they are receiving facials, the patrons do not wear masks.  Her company even said it's okay if she's not comfortable being there because of the pandemic and that she will always have a job.

My friend's dad died of Covid in March.  I live in a city that was hit hard at the beginning.  I have tried to be gentle, I've tried to be firm, I've tried to explain that she's subverting all the good her husband is doing at his own job and that she might get him sick too.  That the clients coming in are people who don't care because anyone with any sense wouldn't be getting a facial right now. That I love her and I am afraid to lose her.

I just back home last night to Florida where I live with my dad and brother..usually I love it here. Yet I just spent the past 3 weeks in Arkansas with my mom (who I hadn’t been able to see in 5 months and I can’t go back again till November at the earliest due to covid). Everything was much safer there and so I was able to go out a few places and I visited with my neighbors horses every night.

I didn’t realize how much I’d missed everything there until it came time to leave. Before covid I could go every 1-2 months to visit but I can’t constantly expose myself and fly right now.
I know things will get easier..but right now I just feel extremely guilty for not being happy here with family and I just look ahead towards the future and see another long 5 months...all I want right now is to go back where it was safe and I had options..here I have to stay home.

Idk sorry for the ramble I’m just..hurting and wondering how I’m gonna even make it through today. It’s like every time I think it can’t hurt worse it does and I’m so tired of it.",2020-07-12 17:37:01
7,Having Workplace Issues. Who exactly do I contact?,2,hpvcbz,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hpvcbz/having_workplace_issues_who_exactly_do_i_contact/,0,"Hey, first of all sorry for my bad English this is the main reason why I decided to submit a post. Currently on my workplace they aren't enforcing the covid safety guidelines and because they are my only job at the time I'm scared they might close at any moment/ get infected and not able to get another job fast, but at the same time I cannot sit back and watch how they are risking the lives of their employees and customers.

First, they revealed in our group chat (which I have proof of) about an employee being sent home because they were infected. They closed for a day or two and then they opened the business again. Since the beginning they had had issues with customers not following distancing rules and although it was pretty obvious this would be the outcome, nobody in management was being serious about it. They had an small amount of ""tools"" to protect ourselves: we ran out of sanitizer, masks, rags/ to sanitize... But this week its the worse of it all, since we currently have been without hot water for 4 days. This is a restaurant, btw.

Second, the manager went a little bit overboard yesterday and brought her kid to the place. The kid was running around touching everything, near costumers, the kitchen and employees; the kid wasn't wearing a mask (neither the dad). It has been less than a week that we were informed there it's someone infected with covid and there's people still waiting for their results and working, also taking in consideration the kid was literally a moving covid sponge from customers to the kitchen. How I am supposed to work in a place were the management are not taking this pandemic seriously and even risking the lives of their kids just to prove the place it's ""safe"", when it clearly isn't??

Can any of you help me find a way to report this/ to who I should report this to and how do I approach this concerns to my boss? I will write 2 letters and tell him to sign them just to make sure I have proof that I informed him about these issues. I live in WI, USA if that helps.

This morning my left arm started hurting. Mainly on the side where my elbow is but could feel it at times in my bicep and shoulder. It kind of came and went throughout the day. This evening my right arm started feeling sore in my bicep when I would extend my arm. Now the tops of my shoulders are sore.

I helped my Wife move our son’s inflatable pool this morning. It’s pretty big but not heavy, just more awkward than anything. We went to the beach this evening and so I loaded and unloaded everything into the truck before we went, when we got there, when we left, and when we got home. I’m also wondering if it has to do with my desk. I’ve recently taken up playing PC games with my friends and my desk sits a little high up and my posture isn’t great.

My family had COVID during the beginning of May, my father being the only family member confirmed as positive (we didn't check the rest because we didn't have major symptoms and we didn't want to risk it - we live in Chile). Fortunately it was nothing more than a big scare, as my father never developed any kind of symptoms beyond a mild cough and diziness sometimes.

But it was such a stressful time (two members of my family I love very much have risks factors) that I don't know if I have recovered yet. Nothing I ever lived came close to the stress we felt. I have a history with depression (having had a major episode in 2016) and panic attacks. I haven't had panic attacks this year which I consider a major accomplishment but I fear a lot having depression again. Now, I haven't been in a specially bad mood lately, but I've been hella stressed from work (I'm a teacher).

I feel like I have worked so hard to get where I want to be in my mental health, and I have so much fear about going back to that dark place I was able to get out from with a lot of effort, yet I find it hard to sleep. I still sleep 8 hours but on an unnatural schedule and I don't rest enough. I'm tired all the time and sometimes it gets addictive to just lie in my bed and stare at the ceiling, rather than doing anything productive or fun.

Before the virus got into my house 2 months ago, I was doing fine with this whole pandemic thing. I was responsible yet I was calm. Now that we had the virus I am so afraid of getting the virus, not knowing if I had it. I had a cough and a stuffy nose for weeks when my dad got diagnosed. As soon as I find it convenient I'll check myself with a doctor, but right now hospitals are crazy in my country. If I had it I never had problems. But I still monitor myself everyday, checking if I can breath properly because I've had my nose stuffed for months and can't breath as well as I used to, which is very logical since my nose is full and it's winter, but it feeds into my hypochondria.

Worst part is I know this is such a petty issue I feel. Like I know I probably had the virus and since I'm 26 I should feel a little bit more statistically safe than I do, but I can't help being afraid, I can't help being sad sometimes. I don't feel I'm depressed because I feel like my sadness is very logical, the world is changing and it affects me, but I know a lot of sadness can develop into something pathological. When we got over this COVID thing I felt so grateful that everyone turned out ok, yet after we got out my godfather got it too and he got a little bit worse than us (still got out of it safely) and it was such an emotional blow. More people I know get affected and it's so sad :(

Sorry for the long rant TL;DR had COVID at home, got over it but feel emotionally drained. Thanks for reading, now listening to myself I realize how irrational some of my fears have become, but I didn't notice until I wrote them down",2020-07-12 00:49:30

They went back to full manning a few weeks ago with a shady excuse. Now, surprise! 4 and counting positive cases. 2 more people showing symptoms. They sent home a few people, but definitely not everyone who was directly exposed. If you don’t have a positive test you don’t go home, even if you’re showing symptoms. Today they told the very few folks they quarantined that their quarantine time is now 8 days instead of 14 because most people show symptoms by then. 

I’m scared. Sad. We have four kids and for the first time in their life there’s absolutely nothing I can really do to protect them. My husband goes from work to the master and I’m sleeping on the couch between sanitizing everything and dropping him off food. I called everyone I could think of, every tip line I could find. One congressional office called me back and said “Try going up the chain of command because there’s nothing we can do, thanks for caring about health and safety.” 

I’m just spent. We’ve done everything right as an individual family. My children don’t deserve this, they’ve given up enough for the navy.

It really sucks these days.

I don't know what happened to my therapist either. We were supposed to have an appointment on Thursday at 2pm and I never heard a word from her. Several text and phone messages and emails and still no word. She has an independent office and is not a part of a practice, so it's not like I know how to get a hold of any other people that would know her if she DID unfortunately catch this awful virus badly enough that she can't use her phone or something x\_x

I hope she hasn't, that would be awful...I could really use some therapy right now, and I am sick and tired of occasionally calling and texting the crisis center. It's so...very bland. Those things, probably similar to suicide phone calls when someone is in distress...they are so generic. It sucks. I know it's probably on purpose as a precaution that is taught to the mostly inexperienced volunteers...volunteers that are mostly young and dumb kids. I only partially mean no offense because...why are volunteer centers allowed to be answered by inexperienced and young people who really don't have the wisdom and grace with communication and life experience to talk with someone that is suicidal or in emotional distress? It's really not a good system =P

I don't now why I just went on a tangent about suicidal call numbers...maybe I am just angry that I don't have anybody to talk to right now. One friend is willingly stuck in co-dependent relationship...I swear, his partner is the only thing he talks about and it is so irritating. I haven't met her yet and I already dislike her, only because...because I see the codependent patterns that he is annoyingly in denial about. Another friend lives in another state, is dealing with breast cancer and also a breakup at the same time. Then another friends still who is already a very stoic person by nature and doesn't open up much even over text and phone calls is now dealing with custody problems with a child and...it really sucks. I don't...I just...

I MISS everyone! I miss them all...and they are always gone or...or far away...

...god...

I hate my emotional problems. I'm so lonely and this pandemic sucks.

I hate that I was born in this shitty country that doesn't take care of the people. Yeah...America is only a nice place to live if you are a RICH asshole. I am not rich, nor an asshole. I am a woman in her 30s who lives in Seattle. I suck at adulting. I can barely function. My mental health as relapsed from this shitty pandemic isolation...and now god knows what happened to my therapist...and even if I wanted to try to look for another therapist, that is a very stressful job all on itself. It sucks. Especially with how strained I imagine therapists are right now with the rise of mental health problems with people right now. I am just another one of those people who's problems feel worse...

I'm so lonely it hurts. I cling to my pet cat a lot when I am at my home, which is most of the time. I feel guilty whenever I cry in front of him...which often. I cry on and off...I cry a lot, and it hurts. It doesn't always help anymore like it used to...because there is nothing out there.

Nobody is there anymore. I wish I could just move away to a European country some day...but I still despise my country for so many reasons. I am so angry all the time. I try my best to avoid the news.

I would like to fall asleep and never wake up again.",2020-07-12 08:40:55

Most of these symptoms are normal for him in some way so we didn’t think anything of it. On day 3 his work called him and told him that there was someone that tested covid positive at his job. He immediately went to get tested, the doctor said they think his test will most likely come back positive and hasn’t felt much better since. We are currently waiting on his results. 

I work in a retail store and am around people 6 days a week 10+ hours a day. I called my boss to tell them and they told me to continue as normal until his results came back. Yesterday I started feeling symptoms, sore throat, headaches &amp; nausea. I went to get tested and the doctor said that there is a good chance that my test will come back negative because it could be too soon despite having mild symptoms. 

The doctor said that no matter my results, if he comes back positive, I have to quarantine with him since we live together. There is no way that my work will let me stay home if my results come back negative. I told the doctor that and she said that I don’t have a choice. 

Has anyone else heard of this happening? Personally, I haven’t. What do I do if my results come back negative? I don’t feel comfortable putting my coworkers and customers at risk if I have to leave this covid bubble everyday and go into the general public?

Like everyone, the virus is affecting most aspects of my life right now, but there are two areas it’s especially getting to me lately.

&#x200B;

First, I switched careers last year in an effort to find more direction and start getting more serious about things. The work I do is community engagement heavy. I was unemployed at the beginning of the year and had just started getting some traction in my search and finding positions that would be great. And then when quarantine began all of those jobs went away because they were all primarily public-facing nonessential positions. In the last couple of weeks, I’ve slowly seen some hope with some jobs returning in my area of interest and even one with a dream organization. But because of this spike in cases again I fear I’m just going to be repeating March all over again. It’s so disheartening.

&#x200B;

Second, I have a lot of stress and worry for my mom and how seriously she’s taking everything. My dad died unexpectedly a couple of years ago and she lives in a not great rural area by herself, so this quarantine has been considerably tough on her with not being able to get out into the city or see the couple friends she does have. She primarily watches news media that I don’t think is treating COVID seriously enough and I constantly worry about her perception of things. Ever since things started reopening I can tell it’s influenced how she perceives the risk of going places and regularly goes to stores just to walk around or pick one thing up. She’s also gone over to a friend's house a few times in the past month who I know doesn’t take things seriously (the friend is going on a casino trip this week). I’m constantly torn between confronting her about my worries and the pressure I feel knowing that she is depressed at home by herself and just trying to relieve that. I was much more direct with her at the beginning of quarantine but at this point, I’m fatigued from worrying about her and don’t want her to feel like I’m constantly being condescending because she is still an adult. The result is me just shouldering all this worry about her that I know is not healthy and I’m feeling at my wits end with it.",2020-07-12 06:41:17
21,Should I cancel my plans I made with friends?,8,hpfdsd,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hpfdsd/should_i_cancel_my_plans_i_made_with_friends/,7,"A few weeks ago, my friend asked me to perform in a music quartet with him and a couple of other people in August for his Grandfathers birthday. I said yes at the time because cases had been low for about a month and I felt comfortable. I was excited to finally be able to do something normal because I have been incredibly anxious and not hanging with anybody since March. 

Now, cases have been rising for the past week and I feel really uncomfortable doing it. I’m supposed to go over to his house next week to rehearse but even the idea of that is making me really anxious. I’m less worried about getting the virus and more concerned about unknowingly giving it to someone. I don’t want to cancel though because he’s already bought all of the music and has come up with a set-list already. Would it be selfish of me to back out of doing this? I don’t want him to hate me.",2020-07-11 22:50:34
22,I’m close to the most stressed I’ve ever been. Not sure how long I can keep avoiding dentist.,1,hpp30l,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hpp30l/im_close_to_the_most_stressed_ive_ever_been_not/,3,"I cracked a tooth on June 15th, and have since been canceling and rescheduling appointments every week. I know my tooth will start to hurt sooner or later and I’ll NEED attention. But I also _know_ if I get COVID, I’d likely die (just trust me). Cognitive dissonance, anyone?

So going to the dentist isn’t a matter of weighing risks of merely getting sick against complications of a broken tooth, but weighing the odds of contracting COVID from a worker and dying. The dentist himself seems to have good protocol, and I’m sure is being safe—it’s his livelihood at risk. It’s the staff I worry about. From what I’ve seen on Snapchat and IG stories, healthcare workers in my area (20-40 somethings) are still partying, taking trips to Vegas, having large gatherings, etc. without masks. I can only assume assistants in the same age group are, too; especially considering people around here believe it’s all some conspiracy. I don’t feel safe having someone like that hovering over me with my mouth open. 

I keep hoping that my governor will shut down again, so my community will be a little bit safer. We went weeks between cases and then suddenly started seeing increases in droves. Worse, they stopped reporting recoveries so all I see are the totals now. We went from like 9 active to 60+ in a couple weeks. I feel like I’m going in blind. 

I really wish I went immediately after lockdown. I do not know whether to wait until I keep getting healthier, losing more weight, more time since last cigarette, etc., or to go now in case the cases grow exponentially again. I can see it going both ways. 

All I can think about is the life or death decision I have to make. I’ve even toyed with the idea of extracting my own tooth, but I’m not sure I have the resolve. I just wish they’d come out and say “you can’t get sick from someone breathing through an N95.”",2020-07-12 09:24:16

I usually keep to myself and work on my personal projects, rarely ever going outside due to a lack of motivation or transportation. Truth be told, the COVID lockdown barely changed anything about my life. It bothered me a little bit to live this way, but I decided that 2020 would be the year I got my life together.

It almost seems like a hilarious joke, now. If I could go back into the past and tell myself, ""don't even bother, man"", I would. Because watching from a distance as the country destroys itself is fucking with me very badly. I already had depression, but it's spiralled into something far worse, to the point where I needed to seek remote help from a therapist. It's helping me keep my sanity in check, but I don't know for how long.

This house has been a prison for years now, and with the lockdown, it's starting to become apparent just how lonely and zombified I've allowed myself to become. Don't get me wrong, I know I'm very fortunate to be able to have a living situation that allows me to remain safe from the virus, but every day I worry for my family members and friends that have been deemed 'essential workers', and being stuck in the middle of a life transition for what might potentially be a whole year.

Oh, and speaking of employers (and I guess, society in general), the way this whole thing is being handled in the US absolutely fucking infuriates me. I feel like people are stealing my future from me, by refusing to comply with guidelines and scientific advice. It feels like a non-stop escalating situation where people refuse to learn their lesson. Greed, selfishness, entitlement, they've all come out in full force and revealed just how stupid and shitty people can be when they've been enabled for their entire lives.

Anyway. Taking a very deep breath here. I don't know what I can do, my depression coupled with this situation really makes it feel like I have nothing to hope for. With no end in sight to this miserableness regarding both the country and my mental health, I'm left wondering when I'm going to be able to live a normal life. When quarantine began, I felt less alone, since everyone was stuck at home just like me, but now it feels like the world is rushing back at a million miles per hour and leaving me behind once more...",2020-07-11 21:40:12

I've been eyeing it for some time, and finally found one that fit the bill. I actually went through the process, got credit checked and approved, was ready to sign and seal. The night before, I started reflecting. What the hell am I doing? I HAVE a car. It's not perfect, but it does the job. I'm not even driving anywhere right now anyway. The furthest I've driven in the last 4 months was a town over. And the payments on this thing? Monstrous. 

I turned it down today. And I thought, I think the real reason I almost went on this deep dive for a shiny new car is because...I just wanted something to look forward to. Before all this went down, I had started my dream job as a teacher, and had a budding new relationship. I had dreams of growing closer with my girlfriend, doing my PhD, getting more involved in my department, maybe even moving closer to work and getting a place with my girlfriend. 

All that is gone now and 4 months later it really seems to be setting in. She left me shortly after it began, I can't really say I blame her. That's way too much to put on a new relationship. All my work went remote. I'm still getting sections to teach but going online is so different. I'm back living with my parents at 32 which I'm actually thankful for, without them and the dogs I think I would have gone crazy. But it's just tough. It's like all this crap has been wiped, like making progress in a video game and finding out you forgot to save. 

So, I don't know. I want to date, but I can't. (though I am going to attempt to meet with someone who agreed to join me for a socially distant walk on Sunday). I want to progress in my career but it's stalled. I want to move out, but money is sparse and I don't want to be completely alone. 

I'm sure I'm not alone in my experience. I'm just feeling particularly down about it in the wake of yesterdays car related revelation. I want to keep myself busy and exercise and do all the self-care, but it's difficult when you don't really see a light on horizon.",2020-07-11 04:23:18

Before all of this shit hit the fan, I had anxiety already. I didn’t have as bad depression and I wasn’t as sad and depressed as I currently am. I also have autism so that makes things drastically worse for me, especially with my anxiety. 

I was never a going out sort of person. I spent a lot of time inside watching films and if I did go out, it would usually be to go to the cinema/movie theatre, I’m a massive cinephile so it makes sense, or I’d go out in town for a few hours, usually to clear my head. 

In February, that, my normal routine, all came to a screeching fucking halt! This horrible shit heel of a virus crossed the pond to the UK where I live. As a matter of fact, my town was one of the first to have cases so that made things so much worse for me mentally. I haven’t left the house since the middle of February. Ever since then, my mental state has slowly but surely deteriorating. 

I have no sense of calm, the virus is raging on and there seems to be no real end in sight, the government seems to be completely jumping the gun with the reopening of everything and I feel helpless and like fucking death everyday. I take no medication as I’m not 18, I’m 17, and in order to actually get medication for my multiple issues, I need to go through the fucked up, broken and twisted up system that made me worse the last time I tried. I take CBD for my anxiety and other, it’s completely legal in the UK just to clarify, and that seems to help but, as I’m a bit of a night owl, it wears off by the time I’m on my lonesome at night. I’m scared that one of my family members will get the virus and bring it home. We are all healthy people so I’m not worrying about any of us dying to be honest but just hearing about the fact that it can cause permanent damage to vital organs, fuck that shit! I can’t cope anymore. My parents have tried to help but they genuinely just don’t get it barely at all. 

This is the worst point I’ve ever been at in my life. I’m lost, I’m helpless, I feel hopeless, I feel like death every day, I’m scared, I’m worried and I have no clue what the fucking shit I’m going to do anymore. I have no routine, I’m nearing the point of becoming a massive germaphobe and I don’t see any sort of end in sight. I don’t think I will ever, ever get through this. I don’t see anything good or positive at the end of this.

I'm 24, and covid 19/lockdowns has been a considerable disruption in my life and mental health in a lot of ways.

Where to begin...

I was in the midst of getting my UK visa to join my husband when everything started closing down. I had returned to the US in January to go through the application process which should have only taken two months maximum. I was literally supposed to have my visa and be returning to my husband the week that everything closed. This has been really difficult because we only just got married in September and I haven't seen him since January.

I've been staying in my parents' home during this time, which I am incredibly grateful for but it has also been really hard for me. I haven't spent more than two weeks in their house since I was 18 years old. When I moved away for college, I never came back, I spent every summer and winter away, and when I met my now-husband I was frequently abroad. We moved in together in the UK last June.

My childhood home surfaces a lot of buried feelings and memories. There was always a sense of nostalgia when I would visit my parents but I never spent enough time to actually recall any ""trauma"". I say ""trauma"" lightly because I was never blatantly abused, but I had a difficult childhood - I'm an only child, I always dealt with loneliness, my mother has PTSD and we always had a troubled relationship, and so on.

So even just spending two months here as was initially expected was going to be difficult... let alone, seven.

Quarantine has been especially long and trying. When visa processing was paused in March, I panicked, I felt trapped because there was no way that I could get back to my husband because you can't travel with a pending visa, and we held out on having my husband come to me because we thought that, surely, concessions would be made for those in my position - spoiler alert, they weren't.

I was already in a bit of a depression, dealing with memories from my childhood, mourning my independence, not feeling like myself, feeling like I was regressing, missing my husband, etc. Then I fell into absolute despair for several weeks, pulled myself out of it, found ways to be productive, got back into healthy habits, and generally found a way to cope for a while. After a month and a half of quarantine I started to feel really frustrated and honestly, abandoned by my husband because of his resistance to coming to be with me in the US - his reason was that it would be too hard to balance work and the time difference - which is difficult but I didn't think would be *too* difficult. I started to feel like my feelings didn't matter, and that supporting me through a difficult time was not more important than his having the ideal comfortable working situation. This sent me into more depression, frustration, which I again had to pull myself out of on my own - this was around May. I kind of sustained myself and my mood for a while until about two weeks ago.

With quarantine orders lifting in a lot of areas, I started to see a lot of my friends going out again, some more responsibly than others, but I haven't been able to do the same as my parents are both vulnerable and my father is extremely anxious about the disease and doesn't feel comfortable with my meeting up with any friends even if we're outdoors and safe. I haven't spent any in-person time with anyone my age in nearly five months. So about two weeks ago I kind of threw the structure that I had created for myself to the wind and fell apart, started spending entire weekends in bed again, and generally feeling like I was just losing it - but this was depression... clearly circumstantial because I am an otherwise very productive and positive person when things are normal.

But I knew it wouldn't last forever, because my husband is finally coming to the US, I'm going to get to see him next week after seven months apart. My visa might finally go through, this month and we could be back in the UK together by September.

This should all be great... I should be happy, but the crippling anxiety hit about two days ago. I dealt with anxiety as a child but it was due to my troubled relationship with my mom. I completely shed that issue when I became independent and moved out. I haven't really experienced it that much during my time here until now.

Starting two days ago I haven't been able to sleep through the night. I keep having all of these ""what if"" anxious thoughts creeping in. Like my brain is rapidly analyzing every possible worst-case scenario imaginable. I'm worried about his transit, I'm worried about my transit, I'm worried about literally everything, rational and irrational, likely and unlikely. The only thing that I'm not that worried about is either one of us contracting the illness, I think we'd be ok, my fears are more-so surrounding anything that could possibly get in the way of us reuniting, from mild to extreme.

It's to the point where I honestly don't know how I'm going to get through the next few days. I'm trying to look forward to his arrival, I'm trying to list the things that I need to do before he comes to keep myself busy, but sometimes I just find myself unable to do anything at all and just frozen with fear. To make matters worse, both my psychiatrist (not for SSRI's or anything - I have mild ADHD) and therapist are out of office this week so I have no one to talk to and nobody to prescribe me anything for this short-term meltdown. Even though I have fewer nights than I can count on one hand to spend alone after this long and incredibly difficult time - I dread each and every one of them because I know that each one will involve hours trying to fall asleep, only to wake up around 1am and remain awake and anxious for the next few hours, maybe several times over.

I've really tried to be introspective in order to understand why I'm feeling this way, rationalize it, and find a way to cope and calm my thoughts. I think that it's because I feel like everything is so precarious right now. I desperately want to see my husband and get back to our life together, I'm so afraid of anything happening that could take it all away. I'm dealing with coming out of a very long, winding emotional rollercoaster, this has not been an easy time and I need to give myself credit because I've coped arguably well for the majority of it. And I think that even though I'm incredibly eager for this next chapter and to feel like I'm moving forward again, there's also discomfort in getting out of this seven-month rut that I've been in, even though I absolutely don't want to continue it and it hasn't been comfortable, I just haven't experienced any change in that amount of time so the prospect of change is triggering all sorts of anxiety for me rather than excitement... and my perception of it all being precarious makes matters so much worse.

Wow, that was incredibly long, so thank you if you've made it this far.

I know that this is a particularly unique situation so it's really hard to offer advice, but I think ultimately, I'm wondering what I can do to stop these doomsday / ""what if"" thoughts and just manage to get through the next few days with my sanity intact? It's like, to the point, where I want my husband to change his plane ticket because of completely irrational and superstitious fears. I've never dealt with anything like this before and I know that it's completely circumstantial - and a culmination of everything that I've been feeling over this period of time, but knowing that it will pass is not enough to get me through the now.

We are lucky to both be able to work  remotely and only leave the house for groceries or taking walks.   


Tips, experiences and any feedback is appreciated. Context and questions below...   


My  family (me 40, wife 43, and three kids 8/5/2)  has been really isolated  since COVID became an issue. We are lucky to both be able to work  remotely and only leave the house for groceries or taking walks.   


I  am at moderate risk due to being an ex-smoker (3years).  Wife is  healthy and low risk. Our eight year old and two year old's only risk  factors are age BUT, the five year old has had three ER visits and one  emergency family doctor visit in the past two to three years. Symptoms  are always the same, shortness of breathe causing a low O2 level.  He  cannot catch his breathe until he has several breathing treatments and a  steroid shot. He has NOT been diagnosed with anything and the doctors  just say we need to keep an eye on it.   


Both my mother and my  wife's mother help with child care. My mother has COPD and is at a high  risk level. Wife's mother is generically healthy with a moderate risk  due to age.   


We live in Texas - Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex and  have a TON of family living  locally.  We have not been hanging out with  many people but do porch visits with more than ample social distancing  (10' to 20').   


My BIL and SIL did not wear masks in public until  the recent mandate.and currently have their kids (11/9/5) in baseball.  They have people over (baseball team) and seem not to be overly  concerned about the risk to them or their kids.   


We live a couple  of miles apart and used to get together every Sunday to have dinner as a  family before COVID. They have a pool and we would grill up some meat,  drink some beer and swim - 'merica.   


Post COVID we haven't.  Both  my BIL and SIL work outside of home but are in generically low risk  professions. I disagree with their kids playing baseball but if they  adequately distance and properly clean it may be a low to moderate risk  worth taking for the kiddos sanity. However, I have a BIG issue with  them inviting people over to hang out (baseball team) but it ain't my  home.   


We have talked a few times about trying to get together  more but I want/need an open chain of communication to feel comfortable  adding them to our ""bubble"".  I am requesting we discuss and share info  about when one of our families has a visitor or takes an on an added risk  activity. Per example, my kids went to the dentist this week - that  would be an added risk factor. An activity beyond daily choirs, work,  life that could expose someone to COVID.   


Currently, they are  unwilling to discuss these things and feel I am being intrusive.  They  just tell me they are responsible for their kids and I should trust them  to keep them safe. These conversations are being had with all the other  people we interact with.   


My wife believes the risk is worth the  reward and I don't disagree but want to limit that risk as much as  possible. If they had people over I would prefer to not hang out for a  week. If someone on the baseball team had a fever then I would like to  know before exposing my kids.   


TLDR: What is an appropriate level of risk management when trying to get family together?",2020-07-11 09:21:29

I work from home and just feel stuck. In life. I have no direction. I feel like everything I dreamed of doing no longer makes sense to me anymore. I don’t align with the person I was when I had dreams and aspirations. I turn 29 in August and honestly feel like the best days of my life have passed. I think daily how I wouldn’t mind getting in a car crash, or maybe catching covid just to give me some reason to fight to live for something. 

I’m too much a coward to actually kill myself, but I just feel such a pointless existence right now just waking up and working and eating and cleaning, wash rinse repeat.

I was once a singer... I don’t want to be one anymore. I don’t want to sing. It was never my dream, always someone else’s. Besides I don’t have the personality to succeed. I don’t know who I am or what I want in life. I’m rapidly gaining weight and see how neither my parents were as heavy as me at my own age. They were extremely healthy, albeit still became overweight... I just see myself heading in that direction much faster. I can’t stop eating the pain away. 

Thankfully I have scheduled to see a therapist for the first time in over a year for Monday. I have a lot more to deal with than I thought when I initially made the appointment.",2020-07-10 22:35:04

My best friend that I've known for years and years...her older brother is ill. I've spent time with her family quite a bit over the years, and he is a very easy going and amiable dude! I like him a lot. And he and his wife love each-other very much. I just found out from her that he has most of the symptoms of covid-19...and that he will be getting an official test soon.

Yes, his symptoms actually show, and he is actually quite ill and bedridden. He is in his late 30s, and so...he has a fighting chance from this thing...right? I hope that didn't sound bad...I just...I really hope he recovers and gets better. I miss spending time with their family, with Devin and him and his wife. We would all sip wine together and discuss ""naughty"" things and erupt in laughter...just...a warm, fun time together.

I remember he proudly showed off this really cool, big beer mug he got from when the Game of Thrones HBO series first started years ago. He had chosen for his ""house"" to display the Kraken of House Greyjoy!

""We Do Not Sow""

""What Is Dead May Never Die""

That was a fun evening! I'm sure all of us fans have our favored and chosen houses...haha. Gosh...what a weird comfort it is to discuss this...I miss people.

God...I f\*cking HATE this f\*cking virus! This virus is an ASSHOLE!

If the virus was an evil person or something, I would cackle with glee whilst I would blast it into the friggin SUN on a rocket! >=P

I'm so sad now though. I still get very angry at times...and now, learning about how our cases keep rising here in the US...I am getting more scared and anxious. I am more scared for my family and friends than for myself.

My anger is often directed at our country's current government for obvious reason but...that is a black hole of a topic.

I wish I had more people to talk to more often, I still get so lonely and scared. I am trying my best to remember what I've learned from trauma therapy to try and take one day at a time, and not to think that this may stretch out in length similar to the 1918 flu pandemic...but hopefully no longer than that one.

I try to not feel too angry for too long about how much time I have ""lost"" already...on top of the time I felt I had lost after my last relationship that crashed into flames. Some topic in my post history from some time ago that still haunts me. It's okay though.

I went yesterday to get tested via nasal swab. I have asthma and have been feeling wheezy lately and my chest sometimes feel heavy. I also suffer from a terrible panic disorder.

I have tried to be as hopeful and optimistic as possible about this whole thing. Every passing day, I find myself more and more hopeless and pessimistic about the future. I am seeing cases rise worse than they were when this pandemic first began.

Sure, I am fortunate to still be alive and healthy and have my family alive and healthy. Please know that I’m not lying when I say that this sucks. I know how serious this virus is. I am still taking all the necessary precautions, such as practicing social distancing, wearing a mask in public, and only going out when necessary. Sometimes, I wonder if it is even doing any good and if it’s even worth it because it seems to be here to stay for the foreseeable future anyway.

While I like being home and am fortunate to still have a job, I just don’t know how much longer I can hold out just being restricted to only going work and home essentially. It’s hard to believe that it has been almost 4 months since I have physically hung out or visited with anyone that wasn’t my immediate family.

I’m seriously hoping for some signs of encouragement and improvement.",2020-07-10 23:03:42

I'm very familiar with self-care and all the ways to help myself. And I reached out to my old therapist last night which helped a bit. 

But I'm just wondering how many others are feeling similarly? Depression, difficulty working on future-related tasks, etc. I see stats in the news about number of Americans suffering clinical depression, etc. But I just wonder who else is feeling this way.

48,Overthinking and Paranoid,3,houiyy,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/houiyy/overthinking_and_paranoid/,0,"On the 25th of June i developed a mild temperature. To give you context, I've been having seasonal allergies all of summer - itchy throat after I come back from the grocery store and one time even breaking out into a rash. Those problems have always lasted a day or two and then resolved on their own. Around the 25th I was having a similar itchy throat, but that evening I was stupid enough to wash my hair late in the evening when it was windy and raining heavily. That night I got a slight temperature and freaked out.

The next day I contacted my family doctor, who recommended that I self isolate until the symptoms resolve. I live with my parents so I completely quarantined in my bedroom. We followed an antibiotics course from a previous prescription of a time when I was having a similar throat issue and the fever settled within a day or two of following it.

The only symptoms I was showing was a sore throat and a fever. No cough, no fatigue, no loss of smell and taste, no chills. I had sinus pressure as well, and am very well acquainted with frequently getting bad sinus problems in the past as well.

 After the course of antibiotics, the mild temperature returned. I followed a course of antihistamines that I was also taking w antibiotics without continuing the dose of antibiotics after that, and again the fever settled. However as soon as I would stop taking medicine the temperature would spike up again.

By the twelfth day of self isolation my anxiety was awful. I was having panic attacks, disturbed sleep, relentless anxiety. I decided to consult my ENT about what I should do. He recommended that I take a chest x ray and some blood and urine tests and send it to him. He suggested that if I wanted I could take a covid test but my parents suggested that I first take these tests and then decide after I get them. None of them had shown any symptoms of covid and were perfectly alright in those days of self isolation in my home.

My chest x ray was normal and after seeing my reports my ENT said that signs were pointing to a bacterial infection. After consulting him in person, (only breaking isolation to go to the hospital) he told me not to panic about it being covid, since by then it had been fifteen days of self isolation and no one I had been in contact with had shown any symptoms of covid. He felt it was a bacterial sinus infection. Also during one of my many compulsive googling sessions, I had read that sinus infections that persisted beyond fifteen days and improved only to return often pointed to being bacterial.

I am now on a heavy course of antibiotics and a corticosteroid medicine. Despite the assurances I am unable to stop being anxious. Sometimes I worry that it is in fact covid, other times I panic about whether I may have contracted it somehow from the x ray room or visit to the hospital and may now have actually gotten it. I compulsively read up on my symptoms all the time. I check my pulse ox levels every half an hour and obsessively monitor my temperature. When my parents randomly cough or clear their throat I start panicking. I try to listen at random times during the night to the sounds of them sleeping well or not. I frequently wake up while sleeping and at this point my heart rate is always slightly up and my muscles are in a constant state of tension because of my anxiety.

Sometimes I wonder if I should have just done the covid test to put myself out of my misery. But I just followed the instructions of my health care providers and self isolated and did what was told of me. Even then i feel like I should have done things differently or obsess over whether I was inadequate in any way. I conduct a post mortem of all my past decisions to try and see how I could have changed outcomes or can change outcomes and overanalyze them. I am in contact w a therapist but it's very difficult to implement her recommendations.

I just want this to end and want to get better. It's been seventeen days of self isolation but the nightmare of what if, the worry that now something awful is going to happen does not leave. I'm unable to let go or surrender to my worries and give up control. I just want some mental relief. Sending love to all those who may be struggling.",2020-07-10 22:40:50

Am I being overly scared?,2,houfpp,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/houfpp/older_people_are_acting_unaffected_by_this_am_i/,1,"My parents, grandparents, and friends’ parents seem to act like the virus and all of these measures are not affecting them at all. None of them fear losing their jobs, most of them are taking a vacation or working from home. They go out and hang out with other older people like normal. They already own houses and nice things, and kids and family to entertain them all day. So I feel like it’s unjustified that I feel really lost in life right now.

My parents have been tag teaming me over the phone right now because I let it slip that I won’t be going to college this semester. I don’t want to quit, I’ve worked years on school! But right now everything seems so unstable. The school doesn’t seem to have a confident plan for teaching both online and offline, and I’m having serious doubts that the professors would handle the challenge well based on what happened last semester. I know that passing and getting that piece of paper is all that matters, but I don’t even know what my job market will look like for that piece of paper by then! Plus, I work for this university. They’ve already sent me home with NO pay since march, how do I know they won’t do it again? I majored in IT so I could get a secure job in a nicer, bigger city with more opportunities and social life. See the problem? The city kinda lost its appeal. I have NO interest in working from home (or living at work as I call it), NO interest in being closer to the virus, and NO interest in living in a depressing, locked down area to hole up in a shitty small apartment every day. 

And that’s not even touching on recent cultural/political shifts, as an lgbt person with a black girlfriend. Oof. I’m 22, I don’t care about politics, world news, and my dreams as much as I used to. I’m trying to be realistic, and not rush into a bad decision. I care about money, and getting a stable job NOW. My parents pressured me to move out 6 months ago— and I’d already been paying my own bills/tuition beforehand. Now that I’m out, they’re still down my throat. They seem to think that coronavirus will have no impact on my current situation, or my future situation. Basically “just push through, there’s so much to look forward to once you get your degree :)”

Like no offense, but I don’t see anything to look forward to. especially if I act in denial like everything’s gonna go my way if I just keep sacrificing money and sanity. I’d rather spend some time saving money, watching how the economy develops, and seriously rethinking my goals and priorities. If things start to turn up and heal, I’d gladly go back to college. Does this equate to throwing away my future?? I feel like I’m losing my heckin mind.",2020-07-10 22:36:21

I work on an assembly line in a factory, and I'm getting up at 4am every morning to be at work on time. I'm getting about 5 hours of sleep per night. 

Because I have off today, I slept about 9 hours last night. But I don't feel refreshed and ready to go; I feel tired and unmotivated, though not enough to take a nap. I just kinda want to lay around and watch tv all day or something. 

Yesterday we had several thunderstorms, hence low barometric pressure. I felt very tired when going to bed last night, likely as a result of the weather. Today is sunny though, so theoretically I should feel a little less blah than last night. 

My brother came downstairs a bit ago, took a shower, and told me that he too felt very sluggish and unmotivated, to the point that he doesn't even feel like gaming. That is very weird for him. He has also had off work all week, so I know hes not tired from working like I might be. 

I know that fatigue is usually a beginning symptom of covid, so having both me and my brother feeling sluggish concerns me. So far we aren't having other symptoms though, though I'm feeling a little sore from work probably. Both my parents have health problems, and I really dont want them getting sick.

The state I live in is one of the few (so far) that is not experiencing a surge in Covid cases. I really hope it stays that way and we don't end up seeing more in the fall, but I am very worried. It seems like more people are wearing masks these days which is good, and most people at least try to keep some distance inside public places. But the ones who refuse.. are usually downright obnoxious about it.     They seem to actually go put of their way to make you feel uncomfortable when they see that you are ""one of the sheeple"". They'll make sure you feel uncomfortable when they notice the mask.

I have seen customers give store employees a hard time about the rules (and unfortunately they cannot enforce them, but can only encourage people to do what we're supposed to). When I've gone grocery shopping I not only get weird looks and eye-rolls, but also have personally experienced people deliberately walking really close, reaching past while talking or laughing, and even leaning over and coughing with their mouth open right next to me.

The worst experience was during my last trip to the laundromat when I kept trying to politely keep my distance from someone who was not wearing a mask. For example, waiting until they were finished loading or unloading a machine next to mine. When they scoffed at me for doing that I told them I'm just trying to do social distancing. Their response was to launch into an irritated tirade about how it's ""not even that big a deal,.. everyone is gonna catch it at some point anyway.., you only catch it once then you'll be immune and you won't have to worry anymore.."", and that they ""had their turn to catch it and were recovering just fine and most of the symptoms are gone"". (Excuse me?!)

Yes they openly admitted in an enclosed space, while not wearing a mask, that they were infected!

When I told them I was high risk they finally backed off. The incident really freaked me out because the only other people I have contact with are also at high risk and have been isolating to avoid exposure.

I have been trying so hard to be careful and keep my loved ones safe - and everyone else out there. Lately I am losing faith in humanity. I rarely go out, but on the occasions that I do there is almost always an experience that leaves me feeling shocked at how unkind (to put it lightly) and selfish people can be.

56,Starting to lose hope,16,hoikbx,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hoikbx/starting_to_lose_hope/,5,"I just turned 21 years old yesterday and I graduate college this December as an early grad but I'm starting to regret it. I'm an advertising major and while I can get into a variety of fields within communications and marketing, most people get jobs from internships and internships being canceled, and the economy suffering, it scares me that my future might be in jeopardy because of the circumstances. Recently I've gotten into e-commerce and started a business not too long ago but being able to support myself from after college is a hit or miss as it would take a miracle to be able to or open up another business (which I plan on doing). 

Outside of careers, I'm starting to lose hope that we'll go back to normal. I hate the fact that people keep pushing this idea of ""new normal."" This isn't normal and should never be. At least say ""temporary normal"" or something along the lines. Like I said I'm in my early 20s and I feel because of COVID, I can't move on with life. I don't know if I'll be able to see my friends when I return to campus. I'm on leadership for a retreat and I don't know if we'll be able to do things the way we always do (which sucks because this one or the one next spring may be my last time getting involved). I don't know if I'll get to walk the stage as an early grad (1.5 years early) in December. I don't know if I'll be able to travel, see the world, meet other people, have valuable face-to-face conversations with others. Hell, I don't even know if I'll be able to see people's smiles in person again. Like I understand why we wear masks but at this point, it feels like mask-wearing is gonna be permanent and it's hard for me to see people's faces covered. I try to stay home or do activities where I don't need one or only need it for a short period of time. 

 I feel like COVID kinda robbed me of my future and of my youth. Prior to COVID, my high school years were rough and my best friend committed during my senior year. College is good but I was dealing with a toxic friend from back home during my first year and I found out about my early grad in the midst of a breakup (that ironically involved a time gap but that's not the point). I had so many things to look forward to prior to going into lockdown such as taking senior photos for my friends and their events, formal, my ring ceremony, and seeing my favorite band in June. Now with this fall being my last semester I'm scared that I won't be able to see my friends as much or that we would get an outbreak, or that I won't be able to do any fun ""senior things."" Even though I'm planning on staying in my college town until next semester, what if things don't improve or even worsen? 

It sucks that my 20s are being robbed.  I'm starting to lose hope thanks to people making bad decisions and people politicizing the virus.",2020-07-10 08:35:43

59,When to get tested?,1,hom8pm,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hom8pm/when_to_get_tested/,1,"Someone I saw in person on Monday just contacted me to let me know she started showing symptoms Thursday evening for COVID-19. She got tested and is now waiting for the results, but she was told she’s showing five out of seven symptoms they look for. We were inside, both wearing masks the entire 2 hours and stayed at least six feet apart almost the entire time. I was helping her with something and stepped in closer a couple times for a second to correct something, but that was it. I’m currently showing no symptoms myself. Should I be getting tested now, or do I wait until she gets her results back to see if she tested positive? I haven’t had any contact with anyone else in over two weeks, so I wouldn’t have any other risk of getting it otherwise. I want to be safe, but I also don’t want to overdo it and clog up the testing system if it’s not necessary for me to get tested yet. Unfortunately our country’s ability to efficiently test isn’t the greatest, and I don’t want to slow the system down for someone who is much more urgently awaiting a test result. Heck, while I certainly plan to exercise caution anyway through wearing a mask on the rare occasions that I leave my place, am I even at a point yet where I would need to quarantine for the safety of others if this other person doesn’t even yet know if she’s positive?",2020-07-10 13:57:56

I've worked at a park for four years, we have a lake and I rent boats (kayaks, rowboats), and I collect fees for people to launch their own. It's been a real mystery to me why we've been open from the start. We never once closed, despite us not offering a single essential service. We work for local government and should be setting some sort of example. When it was chilly, it was easy, we didn't take fees from customers, we didn't allow them in the office, and people only put their own boats in.

I would tell myself, that I can do this. That I am *going to be okay.*

Now summer has come to smack us with the mallet that is company greed. Every executive in the government institution I work for was working from home, everyone in HR, legal, the people that oversee the parks, just one branch on the hierarchy tree above me, stayed home. They are continuing to stay home, and send emails that read nothing short of patronizing. ""You can do this!!"" and ""Thank you for being a front-line in these trying times."" They cooked spaghetti for us (which we had to pick up) as a thank you, and that was it. Now we have to rent our boats, 100 boats across three lakes the city operates. We're in a state that's not doing well, we've had record cases, record hospitalizations.

An older gentleman, who regularly walks around, stood over me a month ago while I was sitting on a bench eating my lunch and had a whole conversation with me, over my food and myself, and he ended by saying he had **it**. I was gobsmacked and asked him to leave, I called two supervisors, nothing came of it.

We're well into renting out equipment, the cleaning materials they gave us to wash life jackets (which must be worn close to your mouth/face, and constantly covered in sweat) were subpar. I wrote to the CDC and to the Health Department, and I gave my findings to my supervisors telling them what we needed to do, for it to even begin to be feasible to rent out this equipment, and I was ignored and told to continue doing it anyway. I get paid $13 per hour, with no benefits to clean up people's bodily fluids (sweat, spit on life vests, fecal matter, pee in our single bathroom) and I'm so frustrated, it's not enough.

I feel so useless, I feel like I have no value here. I can't afford to quit, but at the same time without health insurance I can't afford to be sick. I can't sleep at night, every time I try to lay down all I can feel is my heart pounding uncontrollably.

Today a coworker that we (5 of us) have all worked close with has been exposed to someone who is confirmed positive and she got a test today. I'm sitting here at work, waiting for the results. They tell us we're low risk, they tell us to keep going. God forbid someone can't rent a kayak.

I just (5 minutes ago) broke down to my boss on the phone, pleading with him, asking him why I've put so much energy into a company that values something as unimportant as kayak rentals over their employees safety. Every bit of frustration and sadness came pouring out, I sat in the back of the office crying until someone knocked and I had to go get their kayaks.",2020-07-09 22:26:39

Also the appointment was over the phone. I brought up that I didn’t want the call recorded. She started sounding really anxious and said “oh even if it is just for my records?” I have a feeling if I had not brought that up she would have recorded without telling me.

At the beginning of this people were talking about social distancing etc. as a temporary disruption that was necessary to contain the spread of the virus and keep the hospitals from being overwhelmed. Which to me makes sense and I think that's absolutely right.

But lately I hear people talk about this as the ""new normal"".  Like, this isn't some temporary thing but is a completely new way of life. In the same way 9/11 changed flying by requiring extensive airport security, this pandemic is going to require masks/social distancing/restrictions/everything over Zoom from now on, and like these changes will be with us for good.

And sadly that makes some sense to me. The virus is never going to 100% go away. Even if we get a vaccine it won't be 100% effective and not everyone will take it. So there will still be spread, even if not quite as much, but still reason to keep social distancing in place. 

I just can't imagine this. I don't know what's the point of continuing on with my life. Why should I put in any kind of effort to move forward with my life if my future is going to take place in a dystopian, distanced, virus fearing world? 

I don't want to keep six feet apart forever. I don't want to wear a mask forever. I don't want to do everything over Zoom forever. And I feel as if I don't have a choice, that's what my future holds. And I just can't accept that. I don't know how.

I just want to scream every time I hear the phrase ""new normal"". I can't do it. I don't want this to be the rest of my life. I'm young, in my early 20s. I feel like I had the rest of my life ahead of me. And now I feel like I've lost it all. Maybe I still have the rest of my life, but instead of being in the world I grew up in, it's going to be in a world that's a shadow of it's old self, with a quality of life a fraction of what it was. And I've been hearing all about this ""new normal"" being long term/permanent lately.

I'm sorry if I sound selfish. I don't mean it that way. I know people are dying. I know this virus is serious and that social distancing and these rules are being done with good intentions. But it doesn't make my life any more bearable or my future any more hopeful.",2020-07-09 07:39:42

We both live at home with our families which has made things difficult but manageable. However, she’s been becoming REALLY loose on how she conducts herself through all of this, which has made me question a lot about her judgement. 

A couple of weeks ago, she decided to get her nails done which caused me to stay away from her for two weeks (she wasn’t happy when I refused to hang out). She’s also been “implying” that we should start going to each other’s houses, which I “implied” back, that we need follow the CDC guidelines. If we have to ride in the car to go hangout for any reason, I always try to ride around with the windows down and masks on, which she will have an attitude about. 

I know this is hard for both of us and maybe I’m being paranoid, but it seems that I’m the only one taking this seriously. Both our parents are at risk of developing deadly complications so I’m not sure why she’s acting like this. It’s actually becoming really frustrating.

70,Need to vent,2,hoae33,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hoae33/need_to_vent/,4,"Last week, I had to move out of my apartment.  It was a really, really awful and stressful situation that happened in my apartment, one that put my safety at risk.  It was so bad that I literally had to pack a suitcase and move out in the middle of the night.   Never in my life did I think I would have to **walk** all my stuff in shopping bags and a suitcase down a major road in a downtown area, to the nearest hotel, at 2:30am.  This incident has shaken my trust in other people so badly, I can barely put it into words.  Over the course of last week, this incident culminated with my roommate needing to be talked into going into a psych ward.  What started off as anger, quickly turned into panic, tears, and guilt.  It was a rollercoaster.  I live a quiet life, I don't get caught in the middle of drama, and I'm not trying to be dramatic here but feel like I just had my stability and peace ripped away from me.

I'm at my parents' house, and while I'm grateful that I have a support network, I very badly want to live on my own again.  Sadly, the cost of living is through the roof.

While family was trying to be supportive of me, I find out that one of my relatives came down with COVID-19 symptoms.  I have had a ton of contact with this relative over the last week or so, ever since my apartment incident.

She took a test yesterday, I took mine today.  I've been asked to not come to work, unless she (the relative with symptoms) receives a negative result, in which case I can contact my employer and talk about resuming work.

Now, I know this might be a first world problem, but over the last week I have been stress-eating like you would not believe.  Normally I count calories, and try to get an hour of cardio every day, but all of that has gone straight to the wind.  Between having to worry about what I’m going to do with the rest of my belongings, all my furniture, my limited clothes on hand, having to check into a hotel in the middle of the night, having to move back home, and then having to listen to my parents drone on about how COVID isn't a big deal and ”the experts don’t even know anything”, as well as listening to my parents' constant bickering back and forth - the food has just been making it's way to my mouth constantly, with no self control at all whatsoever.  The minute I'm feeling up for eating normally and going for a good run, I take my test and, in the name of doing the right thing and being safe, I have to stay at home.

Can I even go for a run in this neighborhood?  As long as I don't get in contact with other people?   NOrmally I could deal with sitting around for a couple more days, but the more time I sit here alone, the more time I have to think about my situation with my apartment, and stress myself out. That is the one thing that has kept me sane during this whole pandemic: outdoor exercise.  And now I'm unsure if I can even do that.

My parents have been lecturing me, telling me that I shouldn’t have notified my employer about the possible covid exposure.  “You’re inviting trouble.”  Why, because I have a moral compass?  What if I unknowingly bring COVID19 to work?  We could all be negative, and maybe I’ll feel a bit embarrassed about having a false alarm, but at least my ego will recover.  I tried to do the right thing and somehow this subjects me to lectures from my parents 

I could just beat my head against a wall for hours and hours and hours.  I really could

I thought that I made all the right choices and surrounded myself with good people.  One day everything was stable - the next day, my life was flipped upside down, and the fact that I may have been exposed to COVID is the cherry on top of that.

I wish I could just go out and do whatever I wanted.",2020-07-10 00:14:02

73,60 Y.O. mom wants to travel.,2,ho5f1p,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ho5f1p/60_yo_mom_wants_to_travel/,1,"PERSONS INVOLVED:

* Mom
* A1 - superstitious aunt
* A2 - other aunt
* U1 - uncle who died
* U2 - sickly uncle

BACKGROUND

So. Here's some context for that. My mom works overseas (Rome, Italy), she lives with her two brothers and two sisters (they are 5 in total). She and my aunt were supposed to come home to the Philippines for vacation and do her Social Security (SSS) paperwork. However, covid happened and they had to cancel. And that was that.

MOM'S STRUGGLES

Then she got stuck in quarantine with her siblings. And her stress level went through the roof. You see she's fastidious at keeping the house clean while some of her housemates are slobs. She would have to change the dog's toilet mat because U1 leaves be until it stinks up the house. She would clean the bathroom because it doesn't measure up to her standards, she would have to prep her own meals because the food is too salty and she's being careful with her health. She would trip over the boxes A2 leaves out in the room. She got so anxious because her A1 and U1 would go out and take a walk multiple times a day. She's a type A person in a house full of type B's. She's also taking anti-anxiety meds by the way.

DEATH IN THE FAMILY

Then U1 died of a heart attack last May. He had to be cremated and a funeral service was held BUT he wasn't buried. 

CONSEQUENCE

All five of them have been in Italy for a while now but the only people who are fluent in Italian are my mom and the uncle who just died. So she was the one who did the paperwork for his cremation and funeral, and even now is the one doing the paperwork to get the death benefits. She's also cleaning up his old room (the others aren't helping for some reason), getting U1's affairs in order, 

SUPERSTITION

Shortly after my uncle died, one of my aunts (A1) started pushing the rest of them to get a new apartment. She's a veeeeery superstitious person. When uncle died, she refused to stay alone in their apartment because she afraid. She straight out refused to keep his ashes stay in their apartment. Now this is a really bad time for them to move out because half the people don't have money - mom was unemployed and U2 was on disability. But A1 was pushing for them to move out because it was bad luck to stay in a house where a person has died AND she was telling them to throw out their stuff (furniture, clothes, appliances) because 'You need to have new stuff when moving to a new place'. It was bullshit. She was being domineering because she was the one paying for most of it.

TRAVEL

With all this mom had been pushing to leave that situation and take a vacation here in the Philippines. She's clamoring to go home because in addition to all those stressors, she wants to have my uncle buried. Now I am vehemently opposed to any sort of travel at this time. I am deathly afraid of her getting the virus while travelling that distance. I am also deeply  distrustful of any protocols the Philippine government has in place for travel. There is no direct flight to our island. She would have to land and quarantine at Manila which was the epicenter of the virus in our country. Then there is absolutely no assurance that travel from Manila to our province would be allowed. 

I absolutely do not want her to travel at this time but I'm afraid that I can't change her mind so I have been absolutely sick with worry. I'm just praying that they will close the airports for any sort of travel analogous to her situation.",2020-07-09 19:47:33

I got tested last Wednesday, another coworker got tested the day after on Thursday, at the same place. I was told 3-5 days until results, others were told they'd get results by Saturday. My coworker who got tested Thursday did get her results Saturday and they were negative, awesome! I figured I would get my results early in the week since we got tested at the exact same location. Nothing Monday, nothing Tuesday...I call to check on it and they say it's not back. Nothing Wednesday, nothing today...So now I'm starting to get concerned that my sample has been misplaced because it's been 8 days and I'm really confused how my coworker got her results before me when the tests came from the exact same place and I got my test done before her. She didn't have symptoms, and I had only a minor cough, so it's not like hers would have been prioritized due to it being a probable positive.

So I called again today to check on it and asked if they could just check to make sure that the sample hasn't accidentally been misplaced. I've tried SO HARD to be polite and gentle during these conversations because I know that healthcare workers are extremely swamped and stressed right now. They transferred me to the lab and I started to explain the situation and just asked if they could check on it. Instead the person launched into an extremely long lecture about how don't I know there's a CRISIS in this country and I'm far too impatient and there's literally NO WAY they could have misplaced the sample and I apologized and just tried to explain that the timelines around other's tests from the same location made me concerned and the person wouldn't even let me speak for a second.

Just kept lecturing me about how healthcare workers have priority and labs have test limits and I know that they probably wouldn't have been able to tell me anything but I just wanted someone to hear me, hear that I'm scared and can't work right now because I'm waiting, and I'm just confused around the circumstances, and just double check, that's all. I wasn't angry, I wasn't rude, I just wanted someone to confirm for me that this weird scenario wasn't due to a mistake in the lab. I know that things are bad, I work in research, I'm very scientifically literate, I just wanted to be sure.

76,Need to get a job but scared about spreading the virus,7,hny74k,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hny74k/need_to_get_a_job_but_scared_about_spreading_the/,2,"Hi folks. I just moved back to my apartment with my roommate a couple of days ago (after testing negative a week ago after having been exposed 3 weeks ago and quarantining; currently doing my best to self isolate from roommate for 2 weeks) and need to get a job to pay my rent and for food and whatnot. The thing is, as someone with OCD themed specifically about how my actions may affect others, I’m terrified of spreading the virus. Like, every day for the last few months it feels like I have at least one symptom of illness or another. I’ve had three separate periods of self-induced quarantine periods of at least 7 days.

I wake up every morning with a sore-ish throat because I tend to sleep with my mouth open and my mouth gets really dry. This goes away after a few hours during mid-day and then comes back when I’m lying in bed. Plus, I’ve been having occasional sneezing fits and occasional headaches, which are easily attributed to other things (e.g. I’m vegan and tend to eat less than I should because vegan food is expensive and my grandparents pay for it).

There’s several jobs I’m interested in, like working as a pharmacy tech or working at a general store, but the in-person thing scares me since I never know when my ailments are “the real deal.” I see everyone on social media and stuff posting “Stay home if you’re sick” and what have you, but what constitutes being “sick.” I have certain symptoms that are similar to the virus on a daily basis, which means that I guess I have to quarantine for 14 days every time I get a headache or clear my throat from mucus.

I would work from home, but I’ve noticed that if I don’t have a system where I clock in and out, I undercount my working time frequently because I feel that if I’m not engaged in something every single second, then the time shouldn’t count. I’ve also considered doing DoorDash and even got my application accepted, but feel guilty about having my engine on/running for 40 hours a week for environmental reasons. I know I’m just a basket case of internal ethical dilemmas and I know I shouldn’t be putting such a kerfuffle on the shoulders of internet strangers, but I guess we’re all on this sub for a reason.

77,59 year-old mother wanting to travel/visit internationally,5,hnzarp,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hnzarp/59_yearold_mother_wanting_to_travelvisit/,9,"Hello all, so I recently graduated college -did not have a graduation - and recently started working in Boston. My home country's airport where my 58 year old (widowed) mother lives is closed until late August, and so are many other things. However, she is a U.S citizen and can come to the U.S through a humanitarian flight, which is what she is going to do next week. Among the reasons doing this is because she misses me, wants to have my presence, and send off her last, and youngest of 3 to the real world. I spoke with her today and tried to explain to her the different reasons why its not a good idea, but she broke into tears, saying that I haven't told her how happy I am that she's coming and such, a moment where I could no longer find the words to tell her ""I don't want you to come.""

The rest of my nuclear, extended family, and myself have been strongly advising her NOT to visit me given: 1.) Travel related risks of going through airports/planes/car rides; 2.) Her age, and at risk condition, were she to become infected with COVID-19; 3.) Insecurity of when she would be able to fly back home (easy 1-2 month stay); 4.) Possible interruptions with my life here in Boston (roommates, and myself would NOT be able to go out given her presence here); 5.) NOT the right time, place, or situation to be visiting given all the insecurity; 6.) Despite how much I would enjoy seeing her, it's not worth the short, and long-term risk whatsoever.

Back home, she does not have the need to leave the house for groceries, or go out at all, someone who works for us takes care of these things. She is also safe with my sister and 4 dogs, having everything they both need inside the house. On the other hand the healthcare system there is already at capacity, and any worst case scenario would be exactly that. However, she is already going above and beyond all necessary precautions and processes to prevent anything from happening, except planning travel trips to countries where there is no forced quarantine like back home.

The point where it becomes tough is how anxious the whole pandemic has turned her, and how she longs for things none of us can have, or should do now. She's afraid for me, and very concerned with her well-being too. While I share this, I believe now is the time to act upon feelings selfishly (particularly for this type of situation) for the sake of ourselves, and our loved ones. No matter how much she wants to see me, misses, and loves me, I can NOT take the risk of anything happening to her. This is what she does not seem to understand, it's like one of those moments when you need to listen to your head, not your heart. I feel this pandemic has made us all take irrational decisions when the ones we should be taking are rational ones.

This trip she wants to take is also making me really anxious given here I alone go out to buy groceries and do other things, while if for some reason I get infected, and pass it on to her, I could never live with myself. I just wanted to know some of your thoughts, and possible approaches I could take to convince her not to come in the best possible manner. If I'm not able to convince her, then me and my older brother would take matters into our hands and prevent this from happening another way. I do not want it to reach that point given my mother would probably feel really sad/angry with us for a while, despite the goal being to protect her. There's even a couple of people she knows of her age which have unfortunately passed away due to COVID-19. It's a very shitty, and very sucky situation for everyone, and nobody is where, or how they want to be.",2020-07-09 12:11:36

I'm so glad I found it because now I know I'm not alone.

&#x200B;

I'm really starting to struggle. And a lot of that struggle comes from the actions of my loved ones.  These are people that had taken the lockdown very seriously and minimizing their contact with others.  But in the last few weeks it's as if they've all suddenly changed their minds.  Just yesterday I received a picture from my mother-in-law of her new haircut she just got.  I also find out that my brother-in-law (who is immunocompromised!) has been getting massages. My best friend has been going on camping trips with some of her friends and having back yard parties at their houses. She was also talking about going to get a haircut.

&#x200B;

And here I am avoiding all contact with people.  Refusing to get a haircut that I desperately need because I'm so fearful of having any stranger touch me.  I cannot understand how they are suddenly ok with this.  We've began to see an uptick in cases in our state, things are not getting better, so why are they changing their behavior?

&#x200B;

I almost feel angry about it!  And that's so unusual for me to get angry about other people's behavior.  I do feel like I'm reaching a breaking point and I don't know how to handle it.  I'm so tired of being at home.  I'm tired of feeling paranoid when I so much as go out for a walk (I live in a very populated area with people everywhere).  I'm tired of there being no end in sight.  I know things aren't going to change anytime soon and I don't know how to handle it.  I don't know how to make myself feel ok with this.  I almost wish I could stop caring like my loved ones have so I can just go out and do something normal for once.

The cases are rising, lockdowns are returning, and people are losing their minds again. Even on this subreddit, there doesn't seem to be any good news. There are a million posts about how people are losing all hope for the future, and most of the comments just say ""I feel the same way"" or ""this too will pass."" Sure, it'll pass... in 2021 if we're lucky. 

It feels like the past 3 months of hard work, sacrifice, and tears have all been for nothing. We as a people have been told for 3 months to give up our relationships, our jobs, our businesses, our mental health, and everything in between. Our social and mental needs were treated as luxuries that we had to give up to serve ""the greater good."" 

It's a tragic irony to me that the same people who advocated for mental health to be taken seriously before the pandemic, are now giving mental health little to no priority. ""At least you're not on a ventilator. We're all having a rough time. Quit being so selfish."" How's that any different than what people with depression/anxiety have been hearing for years? 

And now that we're seeing a huge surge in cases and hospitalizations, it seems all we did was delay the inevitable. I figured that even if we didn't have a vaccine, we'd at least have a reliable treatment by now. That maybe things would go back to normal. That I can finally live my life without being judged and insulted for it. That this would be like the flu: Still deadly, but now we know how to fight it. 

But every headline I read is about how people are basically dropping like flies and how going outside for something other than groceries spells certain doom. People are demanding that we go back into lockdown, acting as if staying home for 3 months was nothing and we're all just crybabies who don't want to give up our comfort. 

On the other side, you have the people who refuse to take any precautions, who refuse to wear a mask, and who thinks that anyone who listens to the government is a sheep. That the governors who are working themselves to the bone to keep people safe while not ruining their economy are tyrants. They'll fight the idea of having to wear a mask to their dying breath, and then cry ""tyranny"" when the governor inevitably has to close down the state due to rising cases. 

How did wearing a mask become a political issue? What is so hard about wearing a piece of cloth? Why can't these people understand that the longer they resist taking precautions, the longer this lockdown will last? If I have to choose between wearing a mask and being forced back into my home for 3 more months, I'll take the mask any day. 

Idk what was the point of this rant. It's not like things are going to get better because some dude on reddit is angry. I guess I just wanted to vent. Let me just scream into the void to feel a little better.",2020-07-08 05:22:08

Today I learned that a coworker that I had occasional contact with (months and months) ago passed away from COVID19. Work has had a significant amount of cases, but it's an essential job that can't go WFH. Initially people weren't taking this seriously but since the company implemented mandatory masks it seems like they've finally started accepting it as a real thing. For me, it's sent me spiraling.

I've been having major anxiety over the pandemic for months now on and off, and I was one of the first ones to carry hand sanitizer with me and put a mask on, though I wish I was better about using it and mask hygiene if I'm honest. I'm 32 years old, but I'm extremely overweight and I might have underlying issues with heart and kidney (I don't know for certain, I can't go to a doctor and check). I'm pretty high risk, and even if I survive getting it my finances are such that even if I just need to take a test the $200 cost and the days off waiting for the results might mean I don't make rent, let alone if I actually catch it or worse yet end up having to go to a hospital.

&#x200B;

I'm scared to go into work, but if I don't then I'm a missed paycheck away from homelessness again. I'm just getting back on my feet and everything's unraveling; I'm afraid of losing everything again, I'm afraid of suffering in a hospital racking up a life-destroying amount of debt, I'm afraid of lifelong disability. It's too much. With all this pressure and other issues that aren't relevant to this sub, there doesn't seem to be any hope and there's too much pain and I'm constantly dwelling on suicide just to *get out*.

And yet, her family is full steam ahead on having a large wedding next month as if nothing is happening. Not only that, but we'll have to fly to it from Texas - and we all know how this state is doing right now.  The kicker?

Oh, and the bride will be 8 months pregnant during the ceremony.

I feel stuck. We've already tried getting it through to the family that it's a horrible idea all around, and they're okay with me staying home as long as she still goes.  What the hell do we even do?

As soon as we take a week break from seeing each other though that's when it hits me. Even though I am fortunate enough to have my family around during these times I still get depressed. It just feels like I am waking up every day only to live for my loved ones. Perhaps I am depressed because I feel like a failure for not having my own place and it's even harder to get one now with COVID19 going on. I could also be depressed from just my daily routine of working without being able to go anywhere to have any fun. Even when I go out to get out of the house I feel anxious whenever a person walks by although they are six feet away. I honestly really can't pin point what is causing my depression, but lately I feel like it's getting worse with how consistent is has been lately.

My job wasn't considered essential, but after about a month of working from home, they reclassified us as essential because there was a lot of vandalism and property damage so they had us just come back, drive around, and call the police if we saw anything. Not a big deal, we didn't interact with anyone. 

We do basically customer service/answering questions as people enter the property from a few gates around the edges, and they have us back at the gates now. This has been going on for about half a month now. 

My entire state has made masks mandatory, so I put a couple of signs up at one of the main gates so people see it on the way in. We (employees) are required to wear a mask while on duty. Unless we're at lunch or in the bathroom, basically. 

At the gates, we can get away with pulling the mask down as long as we put it back on if we see someone driving up. I drove by today (some of us are still patrolling) and my coworker in the gate is just in there without a mask, regardless of whether or not people are at the window talking to them. Not only does it look bad, signs all over saying a mask is required on the property yet the person greeting them isn't wearing a mask, but it's a safety issue. 

I feel like I'm doing everything ""right;"" wearing the mask for 8-10 hours a day, washing my hands a million times, disinfecting everything after I use it, yet the people around me are too inconvenienced to do the most basic (required for our job) shit so everything I'm doing feels like it's for nothing. 

Today, my city had a record high of almost 400 cases in one day. There's free testing sites all over the city but they're all full so I can't even be tested for my own peace of mind. 

I'm so tired of this. I want to crawl into a hole and not come out until there's a vaccine, lol. Almost everyone I work with, including myself, has a laundry list of underlying conditions. Yet only like half the people are doing what we're supposed too.

The beginning of lockdown I was managing pretty well. I worked out, ate healthy and was pretty motivated. I was pretty social, skyping/facetiming my friends pretty regularly but shit just kinda hit the fan recently and I don't know how to cope.

I live with my parents, and because of COVID, my first term (and probably year) of university is going to be online. I live in India, and both my best friend and boyfriend are going to be leaving to the US soon and honestly they're the only ones keeping me sane atm. I just don't know what to fucking do anymore, I don't think I have the strength to deal with online courses doing subjects I don't enjoy. My sleep schedule has become so fucked, I go to bed a 6am and wake up at 5pm and I'm just feeling miserable all the time. My city is in complete lockdown and its only getting worse. The social isolation is getting overwhelming. It's difficult to see any hope in the  future. My mother in particular can be so overbearing sometimes and I just feel claustrophobic in my own home. I hate that I'm feeling this way knowing that I'm so fortunate to have a roof over my head and food to eat, knowing how this pandemic has impacted so many lives.

Everything + the boredom (my high school finished in March, and uni only starts in September) is just making me feel so hopeless. I cant eat and I sleep for the sole sake that I dont have to be awake.",2020-07-08 04:42:44

That the Coronavirus vaccine protection may be ""finte"".  


I know that it's been said that we can expect to see a vaccine in 2021. It just feels like unless it really happens that things are not going to get better. That it was silly for me to think maybe over time the longer the virus goes on that it will get weaker. On top of that seeing Fauci bring a lot of negative news about the Coronavirus has really been getting to me.

I don't know how much more of this I can take.  

My story - I quit my job in April to care for my precious mother who is extremely high risk. I adore her, we've been through much loss as a family, so it was really great to be with her at first. She is a vibrant woman, despite her frailty. I take care of her house, I was exercising at home, I had a job coach to work towards getting a remote job, everything felt great considering. I stayed in touch with my friends. 

Then, major game changer.  My state, Arizona, started spiking badly. We break records daily.

And now I'm in a spiral. 

Much of my anxiety is centered around her. Her heart and mind are at odds. She see's the horrible reports, yet, still wants to go to the store. I know she just wants her life back, who doesn't. No reasoning, though, will stop her. She may be very frail but she is also set in her ways. She is a survivor of a very tough life and this mindset has got her through. She is a very successful woman who I'm really proud of. But now I'm afraid this mindset and stubbornness will kill her. She will take little trips to the store (not a lot, maybe once a week). All I can do is drive her, buy her masks and just literally pray that she doesn't get it. 

Life now feels like roulette. Living with this constant high anxiety, worrying about her going out, worrying about the future, worrying that this won't end, is doing me in. I've lost all my motivation, I am gaining weight, I can't stop watching the news, I can't sleep. I can't stand do any thing, anymore. 

She may be physically frail but I'm the one mentally deteriorating. Depressed, helpless and agitated, that's me, all the time now. 

I feel like a hostage to both the grim reality of our numbers and my own mind. I can't accept this.

So, that's it. If you are in a spiking area, or can relate otherwise, please tell me your tips to get through this.  Life and hope go together.  I may be alive but only in the physical sense. Thank you for reading.",2020-07-07 17:14:52

After the loss of my father, I’ve been dealing with extreme anxiety and panic attack which turned into OCD (obsessive thoughts of death) and hypochondriac. I developed an extreme fear of sleep because I’m terrified I might pass away while sleeping (I’m currently seeing a therapist)

So yesterday I woke up and I noticed when I breath in, my nose and throat got irritated (kind of like a burning sensation and this sensation kind of travels up to my ears..and makes my ears feel cold. It sounds so weird) I took a Claritin and it didn’t help that much and also took Tylenol (I developed a headache as well but after taking the Tylenol, the headache went away). Later at night time, I drank some hot tea and it helped a lot with my throat irritation and cough (the irritation kept making me cough)

Today I woke up and measured my oxygen level and heart rate (I have a huge problem with this. I constantly monitor my levels because this is the last thing I did for my dad before he went to the hospital for the last time. My oxygen  level usually stays between 96-99, and sometimes it’ll go down lower but it’ll go back up. It fluctuates all the time. My heart rate is almost always in the 90’s so today when I woke up and saw it was in the low 60’s and even went down to the 50’s, I thought this was it. I have covid because I keep reading the covid positive reddit and many people said they developed a slow heart rate) 

Today my nose and throat is acting up again and it just makes me feel so scared.

I don’t have a fever though. I do have shortness of breath but I don’t know if it’s because of the amount of stress and anxiety I am under 

I went to the ER 2-3 weeks ago and they did an ekg, chest x-ray and checked my ears, nose and throat and everything was normal. I made another appointment to get blood work down on Monday.

I just feel so scared. I want to live for a long time

I felt like there was always a chance for things to get better, so I kept going despite how unsatisfied I was.

I was able to hold on during March, when my state (Kentucky) began to lock down, but ever since April or so I've been having panic attacks constantly. I wake up every morning feeling out of breath, and immediately go right into panic mode. I become inconsolable. Most of the time there's not even a single thing wrong with me, but death feels so inevitable in the hours that follow. I was diagnosed with asthma shortly thereafter, but I can't even tell if I really do have it or if psychosomatic symptoms have just taken over my body.

I just got married at the end of last year to the love of my life, and my life felt like it was starting to turn over a new leaf. We had planned on beginning the process of having children this year and even moving into a house at some point. But COVID-19 has taken all of this away, and I can barely cope.

I'm only 23 years old, but I fear that I will wake up one morning, gasping for air, and be taken away from my wife to a permanent end. I'm too scared to even sleep anymore and I stay up until the dead of night, waiting for my body to get so tired that I just fall asleep without even noticing it. On top of this, I now compulsively take my temperature several times a day, in hopes that I can catch it early and somehow save myself. It's not even noon as I'm writing this, and I feel like I've already taken my temp at least 20 times this morning.

I'm terrified of having my life taken away from me so early. I don't even feel like I'm living anymore. Just surviving and waiting to see if I make it to the end of this okay. Between the chance of death, or losing all quality of life due to the effects of the virus, it doesn't feel like there's much to really live for.

Are there any coping strategies that anyone could recommend to quell my panic, or am I at the point that I need serious therapy?",2020-07-06 19:20:28

The point is, we don't need that money. We are not rich, but recently I got a home office job and I'm helping to pay the house bills. 

I understand my father's side. He cultivated this salon for 20 years and doesn't want to lose his customers. I'm helping to pay the bills at the moment, but my job is temporary, I think he is afraid of being in the red next year.


In the last 3 months, I managed to get him to close the place. But now he wants to reopen, right at the height of the pandemic - our country (Brazil) is having more than 1000 deaths a day. His justification is that he is being careful, but I really think he trusts the mask's power too much - like he's invincible just because he's wearing one. 

I feel that if I put more pressure, he will abandon the idea of ​​going back to work. But I didn't want to be unfair, I understand his side. I confess that this whole situation has been mentally draining. I don't wanna be paranoid, but I'm also afraid of losing my father for something clearly stupid and regretting it later.

This is a little bit of a personal question, but I'm really having a hard time deciding what to do about this situation, and I'm wondering if you all have any advice or could share with me what you would do. I'm having a hard time trusting my reactions to other people's behaviors (in terms of the virus) these days, because I never= know if I'm being overly judgmental or if my frustration is really warranted. As such, I'd appreciate hearing other people's input.

Basically, the situation is that I met someone on an online dating app a few months ago. I'm not looking for anything super long-term, but it's been nice getting to know this person and ""date"" a bit (if doing video calls can really be called dating!). The issue, however, is that they totally don't take the virus seriously at all. They seem to think it's been way blown out of proportion, and this person never took it seriously to begin with. They never took any precautions even back in March and April when things were really bad in my area (which kind of blows my mind). I honestly don't understand how they've come to this conclusion since they seem to be really smart and well-educated otherwise, but...I don't know. I guess they've managed to do it!

We've had very civil discussions about our extreme differences in opinion on the matter, and they don't seem bothered by my views on the matter. Since we won't be meeting up in person for quite a while (my choice, not theirs. They'd have been happy to have met up weeks ago), I figured it's fine that we have such different opinions, and I just kind of decided to...ignore the issue.

Some personal stuff has happened recently, though, that's making it very hard to tolerate this kind of behavior without getting frustrated. It also doesn't help that they told me of some plans they have to take a trip to meet up with large groups of friends and take a road trip to one of the hotspot areas right now. These choices are kind of appalling to me, and it's becoming harder to ignore their bizarre dismissal of what's going on in this country right now.

These things are making me want to break it off, but I hesitate to end a potentially good relationship over something that will be relatively temporary (the virus). (I've had somewhat of a hard time finding people I feel this compatible with in the past.) I'm also not eager to sever one of my few sources of exciting social interaction these days. On the other hand, though, it feels kind of hard to maintain respect for this person intellectually when they seem to be living in complete denial of the illness, suffering, and death that's going on around them. I also wonder how this would actually work out once things improve with the virus. Like, is this someone I'm really going to be able to trust enough to actually hang out with?

So anyway, if anyone has any thoughts on what they would do in the situation, please feel free to share. Thank you for your help!

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: After thinking about this a bit more, I realized the best idea might be for me to ask this person why they believe this virus isn't a real threat. If they say, for example, that no one in their family takes it seriously and they trust their family's judgement, that might be forgivable. If, on the other hand, they say it's because all scientists are liars and Trump is right about everything, that would be...less forgivable. Well, either way, your perspectives and input would still be very much appreciated!

**UPDATE:** I decided to end things with the person. Thank you, everyone, for helping me listen to my gut!",2020-07-06 22:49:07

It feels like a black hole rotting open my chest. The fact that this is going to drag on for years, that I will never really get my life back, that the borders are closed and I can't even flee my country if worse comes to worse and that fucking tyrant gets elected again - it all feels so unknowable and terrifying that I just want to slit my wrist open and get it over with. I literally cannot handle it. I can't do anything but feel numb and beg for death.

The problem is that not reading the news feels like denial. The only reason I'm able to function is when I don't let myself think that this is a permanent state of being. Not reading the news lets me function, but then I read the news again and feel like a delusional idiot living in fairyland. Two more months of this makes me want to scream. Two more years of this just isn't worth enduring. I've already lost almost everything that brings me joy to this fucking pandemic.

Went to a Covid-19 testing site on the 29th, and I'm hoping to hear back this week. 

I have a weak immune system and get sick very easily. I've gotten over the sore throat, loss of taste/smell, sinus congestion, migraines and runny nose---but now I'm entering the coughing/chest congestion phase. The fatigue is causing so much stress. I can barely do anything without it winding me. 

I've got a steroid inhaler from my last episode of sickness in March (thought I had Covid then as I was sick for 5 weeks with multiple doctor visits and 1 ER visit. No tests were available so I had to assume and isolate). 

I've got a vitamin D deficiency problem, but I've been on 10,000 ui/day since January of this year so I'm hoping I won't get as sick this go around. But it's been stressful.

A part of me is scared to death of contracting Covid. I've only been out for groceries, medication pickup and medical appointments/tests. I suspect it might have been the grocery store where I caught this. Dad and I are both at risk, and we just lost Mom in January. 

I'm so frustrated with the number of people acting like this virus is no big deal and that it's not deadly enough to cause concern. I live in Florida, which I think says it all for anyone keeping up with the reports/news.

111,Freaking out,7,hmhusw,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hmhusw/freaking_out/,23," 

I was exposed to covid by my dentist :( 

I'm freaking out!! I was already very anxious to go to the dentist to get my filling fixed that fell out 2.5 months ago. I talked at length with the staff and the dentist, who said they are doing all they can, they wear N95 masks at all times, face shields, sanitize everything, they make all patients wear masks in the common area, etc. Didn't seem perfect like their ventilation is just central A/C and they don't stagger patients. But I wanted to go to them because they use the laser instead of novacaine/needles. They said I would probably be in and out in 10 minutes or so.

It's a very small crowded office, but I figured I would be better getting my tooth dealt with now instead of waiting for the covid numbers to keep climbing (I'm in Minnesota).

When I walked in, I had to be in the hall with the person taking my temp whose surgical mask barely fit, walked passed a patient who was talking to the receptionist and the patient wasn't wearing a mask at all. I was wearing a mask the encounters were brief so I wasn't as concerned except that's not what I was told would be earlier.

The dentist walks in and his N95 mask is litterally falling off his ear (it's the ear loop kind). So he's talking to me while his masks keeps coming off. He has no shield. Before he starts he switches masks to a 3 ply surgical mask. I stop and ask if he wants one of my N95 masks (I brought an extra brand new one) and he said No, he is allowed to wear the surgical mask if he wears his sheild, which he puts on. The shield is so high it only really covers his eyes and part of his nose it sticks out so bad. He starts working on the tooth and his surgical mask falls down passed his nose. As soon as I noticed I ask him to please cover his nose, so he grabs his mask with his gloves and pulls it up, but it keeps falling down. He doesn't change gloves digging in my mouth. The entire time he is over me breathing and talking and the face shield is obviously doing nothing because it is pointing out. And it took FOREVER. It was 45 minutes before I was done and got out of the office as soon as I could!!

I'm horrified!!!! I didn't know what to do, If he has covid I'm for sure going to get it!!! I was so nervous I never would have went if I knew what I know now. I've litterally never left the house except to be in my back yard, since March 11 because I'm so scared to get this my health is very fragile and I have a lot of health issues.  And if he's that lax with me, knowing how nervous I was to begin with, he is the same with other patients so he is exposed big time.

Not knowing anything is the worst part...not knowing or even having a loose idea of a time frame of when this all might finally end and start to fade away.

I hate and am sick and tired of video calls and phone calls...I am very angry all the time over small things that pile up. I get so angry...and I feel so helpless.

My already bad mental health has relapsed badly...I despise this virus. I have more contempt for my failure of a country than I already did before because nobody knows what they are doing or how to do it. I don't want to be here anymore.

I feel completely alone and alienated in all of this. I just want to scream and cry and be told that my feelings of painful helplessness are valid. I only exist...I feel like I am nothing. I don't want to exist this way anymore.

I resent the people who try to push their intrusive cheerfulness or false hope onto those of us that are struggling with mental help in this isolation...it isn't helpful, in case you didn't know.

I miss my lover. I am sexually frustrated, but I am also so numb now because I haven't been touched in a long time that I mostly think about how much I just want to be held more often than I think about actual sex. I miss being touched and caressed and held and cuddled with by another human being that I trust. He treats me as an equal, and he treats me with respect. I miss just being around him too.

I feel so numb now a lot of the time, and dead inside...I don't see a point to anything anymore.

I wish there was some objective but reliable information to look towards.

If that's the case then there is no point in continuing on because we'll just have to wear face masks and social distance for years. There's no point in living if we have to keep living like this for years.

I made a subreddit ([r/AutismVs2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismVs2020)) for the troubling events of this year. Autism brings unique challenges when trying to cope with everything. Now lockdown is coming to an end, things are uncertain and keep changing, burnout is common... Some of us are finding it hard to cope in ways that other people just don't understand.

This new sub was made to help Autistic people and families/friends, to provide a caring and supportive environment for each other.

117,Back/Body Aches continue post Recovery?,1,hmm5pp,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hmm5pp/backbody_aches_continue_post_recovery/,3,"Background: I had COVID in early March. I never had a fever really, but I had horrible body aches/pains that I had never experienced before. Every single part of my body hurt, down to my finger nails. After the aches/pains subsided, I lost my sense of taste/smell for approx. two weeks. I was never tested, as I thought it was either the flu or allergies, or another respiratory tract infection. The loss of taste/smell wasn't documented or reported as a symptom, and it wasn't until late March after I had recovered that my doctor and I put all the pieces together and realized I most likely had COVID, especially considering the people I interacted with whilst sick also lost their sense of taste/smell. 

A couple of weeks back I took the antibody test where I tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, as did everyone else I interacted with during those weeks. They all recovered fine. However, ever since contracting COVID I have had unexplained aches and pains in my back, shoulders, and arms. My doctor discredits it is due to COVID and said it is probably from stress, anxiety, or not getting enough physical activity during quarantine, however I bike/run/walk in combo at least 5 miles everyday, so that cannot be the case. 

Has anyone else had this issue? It's been almost 4 months since I was sick now and it makes me nervous that they haven't gone away.",2020-07-07 06:41:02

I'm supposed to go in at noon tomorrow for the interview and to meet with the person who talked to me on the phone. I am going to wear a mask and I will not be shaking anyone's hand or be next to a lot of people. 

But I have to ask since it seems like we are entering doomer mode again which isn't necessary all bad given that fear does get people to stay more alert of their surroundings, but I have to ask, would it be generally safe to go out for a job interview?

Will tests show positive results more than an entire week before any symptoms might show? or is it more likely that the virus has already been sent on its way in the past week?

My state is one of the few in the USA that is doing pretty well and has a relatively low virus count right now. So we’re continuing to reopen.

Before Covid, I was a super busy college student. I left my apartment at 8AM every morning and didn’t get home until about 8 or 9PM. I usually got at least 2 hours of physical activity a day, and managed to hang out with friends on top of it all. But now, it feels like I can’t even go for a run without being exhausted the rest of the day. A trip to the store leaves me completely drained.

It’s almost like I’m more depressed now than I was back when we were in full-on quarantine. Back in March and April, I couldn’t wait until everything opened back up. But now I just have no ambition for anything. My state is in a place where I could see a friend or two, outside and sitting 6 feet apart. But it’s like I don’t even want to anymore. It honestly just doesn’t feel worth it. My parents offered to take me back to my college apartment to get some of the things I left there back in March, but I don’t really see the point in it. I haven’t spoken to my friends in about 3 weeks, because it doesn’t feel like there’s anything to talk about anymore. I basically force myself to go for a walk or out on a drive once a day, just to get myself out of the house, but even that feels like a huge chore now.

As far as the specific situation - we did best we could. Ordered a minivan size one. Opened windows. Wore mask sanitized hands. Driver also wore mask. (Knock on wood hope fine). 

But we were thinking - in current conditions. Wouldn’t a taxi be safer? Yes I get the “how about just don’t go out or don’t drink to where you can’t drive”. But that’s not answering the question. Between the two - I was thinking taxis generally have always had plexiglass. Plus they work based on a license they have to pay off - so they have incurred debt they have to work - meaning they will have higher chance to value their safety. 

Ride sharing business was always “at will” and based on public voting system - and ratings. Well now it’s socially acceptable to not work for a while with what’s going on - so it’d be higher chance whomever is driving (when they could do food delivery ) has a higher chance they don’t care nor prioritize the virus. Nor care their rating. (Our driver was fine. But HORRIBLE driver. Side swiped and cut other cars - yet he had a 5 star rating. 

I figure a taxi has to at least follow guidelines as they more or less work in compliance with an organization.

With social distancing from friends for months, losing my job over this pandemic, recently ending a long term relationship, and my said mom having a brain aneurysm during the pandemic, I feel drained, lost and mostly severely depressed. 

I need to have a social life again and my friends are trying to get me out to hang and go to parties but the only issue is they are not taking this as seriously as I want them too. When we hang, none of them wear masks and often I am too nervous to wear mine. I keep my distance but ultimately I need to be wearing a mask when I go out.

I wore a mask and gloves, and they still took a few minutes, because they had a lot of orders. The place had a line of people waiting for pick-up, but not a lot of 'space' in between people, defs not 6 feet. I will say that every single person in the line was wearing a mask, though. I did my best to stand apart from the people in line, and then I turned around and saw that behind a little half-sized wall was a dining area. Indoors. With PEOPLE EATING. Like, definitely not 6 feet from the line. It was only 'half full,' I guess, but I also saw a girl at the till remove her mask before bringing food to people. And the guy handling orders, plus the chef? No masks. No gloves. I was so fucking hungry that I got home and like I said, did eat, but reflecting back on that I feel regretful and scared.

I don't think I'll be going out to eat again at any point soon. Everything is fucking terrifying. Why aren't people terrified? I'm so mad that this place doesn't have an e-mail or anything either. They're on Uber Eats and I don't know if I could leave a review or something. I'm honestly still kinda WTF about the whole thing. I'm planning on getting tested in a couple days.

Everything about my situation is wild and weird and nowhere is really 'mine.' I never feel safe. I don't know if I'll ever feel safe again.  


Update: I feel ill today. It could be from an unexpected sunburn I got a couple days ago. I don't seem to be running a fever, but of course I'm terrified now. If I still don't feel well later today/tomorrow I'll be going to get a test. Fuck these people. Fuck any restaurant that's reopening in the USA right now. It's too horrifying. I'm scared for my life and my family's life. This whole experience would have been completely fine if people weren't dining in. How can I hold anyone accountable? I did my best and I still might be fucked. I could die before ever seeing my boyfriend or my home again (been stranded overseas for 3 months). My family could die. And people won't just wear a fucking mask. I'm keen on survival, why aren't others?",2020-07-06 06:03:46

I live in the UK and for the first few months of lockdown I was totally isolated and did not leave my flat almost at all, other than for walks. I had everything delivered and I washed my hands constantly and wore masks. However, I live alone and due to bad mental health I recently managed to get back in contact with my estranged father, who offered for me to go and stay with him and his wife.

My dad took me out to a shopping centre and we walked around busy shops for several hours. I wore a mask and he didn't. Then the following day his stepdaughter and her family came over indoors for hours on their way back from shopping, nobody distanced. And today I heard my dad and his wife cough a few times throughout the day and I was suddenly snapped back to reality. Holy shit. I'm terrified.

I've really fucked up. I can't believe after months of being so careful I've ruined it. My dad and his wife dont take this seriously at all, they never wear masks and they even invited a builder in for a cup of tea.

It was my fault. My vision was a little compromised by my mask positioning. Plus it was early, no coffee yet. Excuses. I failed to notice her until it was too late, so we crossed paths in a parking lot.

Which is worse, a sneeze or a cough? Sneezes scare me because they're more forceful, so I assume they spread more virus..*.if* the sneezing person has Covid. Coughs scare me because I am more likely to fear it's a possible Covid-19 symptom. I have no idea which to hope this shopper's polite hiccup was.

I'm not talking about confirmed exposures or being asked to quarantine or to not come into work. I have lived very cautiously since March.

I am very grateful that I have not been sick, so far. And I am aware that if I ever do get sick, it isn't necessarily logical to blame some event that I had spent the previous 2 weeks worrying about, because something or someone else might have made me sick, and I will probably never know.

What do you think about this ? 

Thanks you.",2020-07-04 04:02:25

170,Which is safer: working full time in factory or student teaching?,4,hkne7o,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hkne7o/which_is_safer_working_full_time_in_factory_or/,2,"I (24F) have a huge decision to make before September: do I go ahead with student teaching to finish my college degree, or do I postpone it a year and work full time in a factory? With Covid and flu season coming up, I dont know which is less risky. 

With student teaching, I would be potentially in contact with a hundred or more students per day, even if they wore masks. Classrooms would be clean, for the most part. Lesson planning still would be very stressful. 

Working full time in a factory, I'd be in contact with fewer people who are required to wear masks and temp check when they arrive to work. Bathrooms and break rooms get cleaned/sanitized, but general work areas and tools do not. A lot of people dont wear their masks properly, or pull them down to talk sometimes. My department is somewhat crowded, so it's hard to social distance at all times. 

I've been dealing with a crap ton of anxiety over Covid because I still am living with my parents who have health issues; mom has heart problems and obesity, dad has diabetes but is otherwise fit. My house is small with one bathroom, so self-isolation would be impossible in case I or someone else got sick. This makes me literally terrified of getting sick. Every single day I am overanalyzing every ache, pain, sniffle, you name it, hoping to God it isn't Covid. My job is physically demanding and I work long hours, so I often am sore. Some days I'm so terrified and hopeless I sit and cry alone for awhile. I struggle to focus and concentrate, I have digestive issues at times, etc. It's gotten to the point that my doctor put me on meds and I have psychotherapy and counseling appointments scheduled the end of this month. I'm wishing they were sooner. 

Also, seeing the unbelievable stupidity of so many Americans refusing to wear masks or social distance and trying to get infected so this pandemic ends sooner is making my head spin.m, and it's not doing my anxiety any good either. 

I feel like I have nowhere to go, and that neither place is safer than the other. As for working, I really dont know if anything else is going to be safer either.

173,visiting grandparents?,5,hkkt1x,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hkkt1x/visiting_grandparents/,6,"Hey everyone, I’m 22 years old and live two hours away from my parents. In June my mom went to stay with my grandparents who live about 10 hours away to shop/run errands/do stuff around the house for them. I honestly didn’t really see the point as all of our family except for us lives in that state, so they already have people visiting with them in the front yard and dropping off groceries. She tried to get me to come with her but I didn’t feel comfortable given covid. When she was there she visited with family other than my grandparents (she said it was at a distance but the photos looked like they were all close together). 

Now my mom wants to go again and my dad is pressuring me to go with her. They tell me that “they’re not getting any younger”, but I feel like it’s better to communicate with them over the phone instead of putting them at risk by staying at their house for just a week. The state that my grandparents live in also just made it so that anyone coming there from another state has to quarantine at home, so if we went we couldn’t even run errands or do anything for them. The way I see it, it’s just putting them at risk so we can see them in person. I told my mom that no one else I know is going to stay with elderly relatives right now and she said it’s because they’re choosing partying over family. I’ve been staying home except for errands and my bf is the only person I see, and my friends aren’t reckless either. She doesn’t get that you can get it even if you’re careful. 

My grandparents are both in their early 80s and have conditions that can complicate covid. I told my grandma that I’d come later this summer if things were looking better, but cases are rising in my state and everything just opened up without restrictions. I know that I could quarantine for two weeks beforehand but I don’t want to take the chance, especially because it’s not that bad where they live and I don’t want to bring anything. They miss me a lot but I’ve spent the last few summers overseas so I’ve only been seeing them once a year anyways, I don’t understand why it has to be now. 

I just get really anxious about it because my parents kind of make me feel guilty and I feel like they’re gonna bring up the fact that I see my boyfriend, but he’s the only person I see at all and we’re younger. I really love my grandparents but they’re in a high risk group given their age and pre existing conditions. I can’t stop my mom from going but I feel like it’s unfair of them to put that kind of pressure on me.

Mostly due to cornoavirus but also my time management and being busy with classes and other personal projects have made it hard to make time to see them physically. I've wanted to change that in recent weeks. I had to turn down an offer to help a buddy move out of a house due to concerns of cornoavirus since it was indoors even with masks.

Now, i am being offered the chance to hang out with some buddies at a beach town since one of them has a home near a beach. They said we don't have to necessarily go to a bar if I have concerns for coronavirus. They said the group can mostly chill at the house and outside backyard/beach area (that doesn't have much people since it is a beach house). I want to go and just practice precaution but I still live with parents that are in their late 50's/early 60's. They don't have diabetes, cancer, or heart problems or anything but they're not necessarily in tip top shape either and tend to have other ailments that don't necessarily make one susceptible to cornovarus, but still.

It's tough because it is July 4th, the summer will soon end without me really taking advantage of the weather being home a lot, and haven't seen friends in a while. However, if I get the virus from one of them or from the location that we're in, especially since a lot of people where I live are going to these beach towns for the 4th, then that would suck because I could spread it to my folks. I would be upset if I somehow spread it to my folks and they got sick. I don't know how the virus would react to them. I know certain blood types are more susceptible then others but still.

This is crossposted with r/Teachers and r/needadvice.

I (27F) am a music teacher. Due to a variety of circumstances, I have yet to be at a school longer than a year which has been really tough. My first job (PreK-8th) was part-time and I was was barely making rent. My second job (5th-8th) was nice but it was a long-term sub position. At my third job (PreK-5th), I was absolutely miserable every single day and decided that teaching elementary music was not for me. I resigned that position and last summer I finally found a job teaching high school. I finally felt like I found a school where I belonged and I had room to grow for several years.

About two months ago my school informed me that they would not be renewing my contract. The circumstances are really sketchy and I spent weeks trying to advocate for myself and seek legal advice but ultimately, even though the school's behavior is shitty, it is not illegal as teachers in the first 3 years of service in the district have basically no rights. This has been an absolutely devastating blow. It really feels like a bad breakup. I am so upset and frustrated that I need to find a new job for the fifth year in a row in the middle of a global pandemic and massive economic crisis.

I can't decide if I should pursue teaching in the fall or not. On one hand, I feel like I keep getting knocked down by this profession and a little break might be a good idea. I love teaching music but all of these shitty situations have been really hard and discouraging. I am also EXTREMELY concerned about the safety of returning to school in the fall. My state (MA) has released some guidelines for reopening schools and they are absolutely ridiculous - basically schools need to obtain their own PPE, everyone needs to stay 6 ft apart, classes can't be more than 10 people, etc. This is tough for your average homeroom teacher but even tougher for a music teacher like me - I often see 200+ students in a given day. Will I get sick? Will I be hired somewhere just to have my position cut three weeks later? Will I only be able to go from home to work and back and not be able to see any of my family because I'm not ""quarantined""?

On the other hand, I don't know what kind of job I could get that would be any safer. Waiting tables of unmasked people seems extremely dangerous. Leaning on my parents for support is not an option so I need to find something where I can pay rent and be able to support myself.

Which brings me to the next issue: I have no choice but to move out of my apartment due to major landlord/roommate issues - my landlord has done some really sketchy stuff that would be illegal in other states. My roommate is extremely unsafe and my landlord doesn't take my complaints seriously. So now I need to find an apartment as well. I am wanting to find a nice place that will allow my pet but I am worried that by the time I find a job, I will have to rush to get an apartment and may end up in another bad situation. Part of me doesn't want to wait until I have a job to look for apartments but I won't know what I can afford if I do that.

I am so overwhelmed by all of this that I can't bring myself to make any progress. I am hoping to talk to a career center to help make my resume and cover letter look better but I am having trouble finding places that aren't coaching services, which I am not interested in.

I feel like I'm in over my head. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading.",2020-07-03 02:33:35

I have tried and tried to argue that we should cancel and not go. The Florida numbers terrify me, but they insist that Disney has enough precautions in place. They think the numbers 'don't correlate with deaths' and think we have all already had the virus.

My mom is early 60's and dad in 50's. I am so so scared that I am going to be planning their funerals because of this choice to go. I am an only child. I have basically no other family outside of them. I have the option to go and I am so torn because nothing will change their mind, and what if me being there makes them stay at least a bit more cautious if I keep reminding them of things? What if this is the last time I get to spend with them before they die? I don't want to go. But I'm going to feel insanely worried no matter what I choose. Maybe if I'm there I can prevent something?

I can't stop crying. I know my mom deserves a vacation with how hard she's working, but why this?! WHY FLORIDA?!? I don't know what to do and I know I'll regret either choice because I know for a fact that they'll go with or without me. I'm young and low risk, but I am so much more concerned about them than me. I am praying so hard that Disney will just shutdown anyway but based on what I've read, they won't.

\*Edit\* These comments are an example of why I feel so completely torn. Some sources say it's not as bad as I'm thinking, some say it's going to be catastrophic and unavoidable. There is so much media distrust and I don't know who to believe or what to do. 21 btw. :(",2020-07-03 02:02:10

I've not stepped inside a building besides my own house, nor have my parents (who are both 65+), since mid-March. Before this, I worked as a flight attendant, so to say this has been a shift in my usual lifestyle is a massive understatement. Losing my job and being unable to travel, see friends, or do pretty much anything has been hard all along but recently it's been getting even worse and is really damaging my mental health. I already struggled with depression and anxiety before this, but I always used the things I enjoyed doing as an outlet to help, and now it feels like all of that is just gone indefinitely.

What's been especially hard recently is seeing people start to get together with friends one on one or in small groups and resume some normal activities. I live in a state that's doing exceptionally well now compared to other places in the country, so it seems that this is fairly low risk. However, I can't really partake in this because a) I'm still nervous to with my parents' age, and b) I literally have no friends near me. My friends are all spread out around the country, and up until now the entire foundation of my social life was based on the fact that I could fly anywhere in the world for free and see those I love, which has now been taken from me entirely. I'm mentally just so exhausted and don't know how long I can keep going on like this. I feel like I've lost everything I love, including getting to see even one person I care about, and it feels like there's just no end in sight.

My best friend lives in Orlando, FL (yikes lol) and works at home for Disney. She suggested for me to come visit next week, as Disney is reopening soon and she gets to go to an employees only day before they do and bring a guest. I feel like maybe I'm insane for even considering this, but I'm so desperate to do literally anything that feels somewhat normal at this point and that allows me to see someone I love. I would fly down, go to the park with her, quarantine in her house together for two weeks afterwards, and then rent a car and drive 18 hours back up north over two days before going back to my parents' house. Disney is implementing a lot of safety measures (reduced capacity, masks everywhere, sanitizing, distancing, etc., and on the employee days everyone should be following the rules), but Florida is such a nightmare right now I have to wonder if it's irresponsible both for my own safety and the safety of others to go there at all right now. The numbers really seem like NY 2.0 or worse, but unfortunately this is my only friend I can see who would be able to quarantine for two weeks like this so that I can go home eventually. Maybe I should just wait and see if FL gets any better and reconsider visiting?

I'm having a really hard time finding any nuance on these kinds of things - I feel like I only see people saying I'm risking killing my parents any time I leave the house, or that the virus is all fake anyways - except on this sub. So I'm interested in if y'all have any thoughts on this and whether anyone has decided to do something similar, and also on any ways in general you've been getting through not seeing any loved ones with seemingly no end in sight.

If I do have to go in, I order and wait outside until it’s done. I have two European versions of the N95 and a regular cloth mask that I rotate with the ones not being used hanging from my rear view and baking in the Texas sun. Luckily our county has a mask mandate so 99% of people are wearing them but I don’t interact with people not in masks and always keep distance. I always sanitize every time I get back in my truck. All drop offs are contactless. I don’t go anywhere outside of work. 

I’m 31 and obese (6’1” and 277lbs.). A cursory search puts me at 36.5 BMI. I carry most of my weight in my midsection. I’ve also been a smoker for about 15 years. My health anxiety has kept me from a doctor (aside from infections/colds, etc.) for quite a long time so I’m not even sure if I have any other comorbidities. I’m constantly worried that I have it. Every sensation sends a shock of anxiety through my system. My allergies have been awful throughout this whole thing (the Saharan Dust isn’t helping) so every scratchy throat, cough, congested nose, etc. sends me near panic. 

I’m terrified that if I catch this thing, that’ll be the end for me. I keep having these awful visions of going to the hospital and never leaving, never getting the chance to say goodbye to my Wife and son. I just want this to all be over and I want my normal life back.",2020-07-02 21:37:51

I'm looking back on that date now and wondering if it's the last time I will ever experience true joy. Everything that brings me joy in life is gone now and I don't know if it will ever return. My favorite karaoke bar closed for good, dancing is too dangerous, and movie theaters may become a thing of the past. I'm beginning to think this pandemic will never end, especially due to our piss poor leadership and all the irresponsible chuds in this country who think the virus is fake news. If we have to live like this for years and years, we will get used to it and never go back. I can't imagine a future where social interaction is something that only occurs over Zoom, and where my wedding, child's birth, and even funeral have to occur virtually. A future where people always wear masks and treat other human beings like ""the floor is lava"" isn't living. It's literally hell.

One of the most painful things about this recent breakup is the fact that she told me people need 10 hugs a day to be healthy. The way things are going, we'll be lucky to get 10 hugs a decade.

I waited several months for them to finally stop their hiring freeze due to COVID and then an additional few weeks to actually start the job after I recieved the offer. 

I've just started back very recently and the anxiety regarding working in an enclosed area is ruining the experience for me. The county I live in is spiking hardcore right now because of idiots who don't believe in the virus.

The job itself is doing its best. Everyone's desks are distanced and people wear masks when wandering around, but not when they are sitting at their own desks which seems reasonable enough since they are distanced. I have been in training which has unfortunately placed me in some situations where my superiors have had extended face to face speaking with me, with them unmasked. I'm too new to say anything and I don't want to come off as demanding. 

I love the work I am doing, and am very passionate about it. I love the company culture and how they do what they do. This would be the most amazing thing if it weren't for COVID. 

I'm just so anxious that I will catch something from work and get sick and die. Or bring something home and give it to my partner. It is a small office with less than 10 people, so I'm guessing chances are low. How do I just accept that I need to take risks to be able to work?",2020-07-02 07:38:36

With  everything going crazy(covid19), I wanted to reach out and see what  people thought about my current health and hopefully get some insight on  what I should be doing.

Here is some background:

I'm 35 years old. I'm half-black and half- white.

I  use a statin to control my high Cholesterol(thanks dad)My current  weight is 255(down from 286 in April of this year) - My doc is happy  with the weight loss. My  **Glucose**  level is 104(high), according to my doctor, I'm pre-diabetic, I know  you can stop going in the wrong direction in regards to becoming  diabetic.  I think I'm heading in the right direction.

My blood pressure is 126/80 (slightly elevated)

Since  April, I have done a 180 in regards to my health. I don't eat fast food  anymore unless it's a salad(I do just all the nutrition stats so to  make sure it's not COMPLETELY unhealthy. I drink water like crazy. I  might have one soda a month but I know they're loaded with sugar.

&#x200B;

I had a recent physical, with the above results.

For  exercise, I have been biking like crazy, anything from 45-100 minutes a  day, at least 3 times a week in the evenings after work. On my  non-biking days, I have been playing basketball with my two sons.

I have been also taking Vitamin D and C, just to help with my immune system.

I  know there is a lot of concern with CO-VID19, am I just screwed if I  get sick? I know there isn't a Yes or No answer. I just wanted to get  some insight. It seems that I might be in trouble for severe/deathly  outcome.

Seems I'm like borderline high in some categories but it all seems fixable with time.

I advised her to get tested and to stay quarantined but she refused and stated that she had to work. I was both angry and scared that she would disregard not only her health but put others at risk too! 

I called the non emergency line of the police to ask for advice. They said that they don't deal with this and to call the health care department. I looked up the number of the department of health of my city and they were not connected. So, Icalled the coronavirus response team of my state and they notified me that they have no protocol to deal with this and transferred me to the department of health. This time the phone was ringing and someone picked up. I told her a quick summary of the situation and she told me to hold on because ""this sounds like it's going to be a good story"". Wtf?! After a brief moment she went back on and I told her everything. She said that there is nothing anyone can do and that if my sister was truly sick with Covid-19 she wouldn't be able to get up. I then asked her to clarify because there are asymptomatic people as well and why are we all taking precaution then? I then asked her if what she is saying is that my sister is allowed to go about and infect people. She didn't answer and ended the conversation. I was baffeled. I tried asking Reddit for advice but all of the subreddits that I tried removed anything that had to do with coronavirus. I felt desperate.

Since my sister works as a freelancer, I cannot call her work place so I texted her to at least stay away from my brother who has a compromised immune system and warned him about her. That didn't stop her. She went over to his apartment and by early June, he was feeling very ill and got tested positive for Covid-19. By some miracle, he is doing better now. Could be because he got medical help asap. 

I just don't get it! Why have a coronavirus response team when they don't do anything?! Why have a health department?! Why is no one else trying to address this?!

I'm doing my best to not fucking lose it when I see people getting together as though nothing is happening. The EU just shut down borders. I am not based in the EU, but I was planning on routing through it to get home eventually. Nope, not fucking happening. I'm still working around visas and closures and general bureaucrat nonsense, as usual, except nothing is as usual.  


I haven't seen my partner since March. Six week trip. Suddenly 3 months+. People have stopped correcting me when I tell them I may not be able to get home until 2021.

I've seen and hung out with one friend, and even that's risky I know, but I'm planning to temporarily relocate because life with my family is wearing me down (friend lives alone, we will be using private transport to relocate, and yes I am going to stay the fuck inside when I get to said location, and I will be testing for the virus and antibodies this week).

216,Roommate Not Social Distancing. Left Apartment. Ruining My Girlfriend and I's Relationship,7,hiungs,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hiungs/roommate_not_social_distancing_left_apartment/,15,"So when COVID lockdowns were just starting up me and my gf stayed at her parents' house for two months on a LOA from our job because our roommate was not social distancing and taking any of it seriously.




After the two months my gf had to go back financially despite being at risk. I'm currently staying at my mother's house feeling like a needed a break and so she can lay the land over at the apartment. Since I've been gone the roommate has people over, going out and getting food delivered every day and just invited 8 people to go hang out at a river tomorrow. And her brother who is staying over the apartment for free and going to bars and seeing a girl. My girlfriend is really passive about it. She understands that COVID is a serious thing but isn't doing anything to try and stop or limit this behavior. It's our living space too.




Now I've gone back to my retail job after 3 months and I just felt disgusted that most of my coworkers were not taking it seriously and our store is not requiring masks for customers despite it being state law or having cleaning done. I was working for 8 hours and I did not see one person clean anything.




I am in my mid 20s but I was a premature baby whose lungs were not fully developed and had to stay in the hospital for a month, was a smoker and when I do get sick I'm sick for awhile. I know I won't die but there still is a chance of getting really sick. Social distancing and wearing a mask is just the right thing to do. I just don't understand how one can be so oblivious to the world.




I have really bad anxiety and I feel like I can't even bring up my concerns. I don't want to tell a person how to live there life but this is affecting every facet of my life right now because of the behavior of one person. The worst thing the roommate has asthma. So she's just an idiot.




I really don't know what to do. I thought the roommate would change when my girlfriend got back but nothing has. I don't want to live there anymore nor do I want this to ruin our relationship. I'm not on the lease so I have no legal obligation.




What should I do? How can I convince COVID is a serious thing and to respect my feelings?

Today, my grandparents are having their dog of 13 years put down due to advanced muscular atrophy. Having spent the majority of my waking time at my grandparents’ house whilst growing up, I loved this dog and really wanted to say goodbye, something I wasn’t able to do with my father’s dog in 2017 because I was about to start finals at college. 

And so I did. I had my grandparents bring the dog to where I was staying on their way to the vet and said goodbye to her outside, wearing a mask, while both my grandparents were 10+ feet away. I pet her a total of 3 times with two fingers and let her lick me a couple times.

The reason I feel guilty is that someone in my household tested positive for covid 14 days ago, but then negative 12 and 8 days ago. I’ve been predominantly locked up in my room trying to both avoid exposure and avoid giving it to others in the household, though none of them have been quarantining at all, which I’ve outspokenly disagreed with.

None of us have had any symptoms, so I figured it’d probably be okay if I at least pet my dog a few times before she departed. And so I did. I feel really guilty because I of course don’t want to personally cause unnecessary spread, but I guess I figured that the chances of giving it to the dog and then her giving it to the vet in a span of an hour were probably pretty close to nil (which is ofc what I’m asking here).

I know it was incredibly selfish of me and I’m truly sorry. I just wanted to give my dog a proper goodbye that I never could for my father’s.",2020-06-30 18:55:50

I have never felt as bad mental health wise as I do right now. I think if I counted, I have been in tears almost every day of this 3 month quarantine. I’ve always been the ‘sensitive’ one, but this is every DAY.  I am so hopeless and miserable. I am stuck in a house with my parents and the fights we have from being around each other so often just get worse every time.

I’m in the US. I’m not in a state with a current surge, but does it matter? The more other states surge, the more it spreads, the more things are cancelled regardless and life strays from any chance of normal. I’m furious that we have to live like this just because we let it get so out of hand. I’m FURIOUS that our cases rise while the rest of the world finds ways to get back to normal. I’m furious that everything that could possibly go wrong for me in 2020  has gone wrong, and is effectively the worst year of my life.

A vaccine is not a cure-all like everyone thinks. The logistics of distribution of one are impossible enough as it is. I’m in a country the rest of the world now hates and mocks, as they should, and I feel so grossly ashamed to be American.

 I cannot find a single job that will hire me in my field. Great year to graduate, 2020. Welcome to the real world. Get ready to default on your loans! I don't even have the motivation to job hunt anymore, because nothing feels like it matters.

I’ve never felt so BITTER and angry and sad and upset and confused. I hate this so much. I think I used to be happy, at one point, but I can’t say I’ve felt a genuine shred of it at all in months. I have bottled up so much shit that I am at a breaking point.  I felt no pride over my own graduation. I was too busy reading about the bleak outlook of all these deaths.

Who can honestly tell me that this year is going to get better? Part of me’s already looking forward to when the tensions in November rise to the point of war and, hey, maybe we’ll all just be wiped out regardless.

By improving my life I mean finding something so me and the gf can finally move in together and get married. Now with COVID19 and having to stay at the home with my family nowadays it's been rough trying to get through. Not to many places are hiring aside from the essential places and it's hard to find something that can pay enough for a place. I've really lost the passion to find what I want to do for my career and just want something that can get by. I'd say my only passion right now is to find a place to live with my gf so we can be together. You can't even get married right now because of COVID19 since you can't have a gathering of a certain number of people. Even if you do social distancing at a church it's still a risk.   


It also hasn't helped with staying home all the time it's not motivated me to go out and try to figure out life right now.

Well, I have certain co-workers who do not “believe” in the virus and refuse to go around. They walk right next to me and when I ask them to please go around they say things like “Oh, I just don’t know what to do or who to ask anymore about where to go” That’s such BS.

Like I mentioned, I have the feeling I and my wife have contracted covid. I do not know what to do and am kind of freaking out. I'm trying to not think about it but am unable to do so. I have followed protocol as best I could, masks, hand sanitizer, hand washes etc. yet here I am.

  


Let me start with what I feel right now. I feel like I have a cold with no runny nose but a very dry nasal passage/throat. I have a fever which when doing routine things like walking around isn't showing, but the moment I get in bed/couch or put a comforter on me, I can feel the heat. Still no cough, but I feel something very strange in my throat, like something is in there and I'm scared to try and cough. My wife has a non persistent cough but shares all the other things I mentioned.

  


All of my family stays in another country and currently we are the only two here in Florida. I am genuinely scared and have no idea what I'm doing. I'm trying to put on a brave face so I do not scare my wife but I'm freaking out.

  


I tried reading as much as I could online on what and how to take care of myself and my wife, but additional resources would be appreciated. But more than that, I needed a place to talk this out and be heard. Just felt that I needed some support and the first thing that came to mind was to get on Reddit.

I bought a thermometer on Amazon and am waiting to get it so I can create a temperature log. I'm also maintaining a log of all medicines we are taking to control any fever or cough symptoms. Ideas and thoughts would be appreciated.

My doctor was kind enough to call in some xanax to help while we wait, but I'm not leaving the house until a negative test result so I have to wait for someone to pick them up for me. :(

My symptoms were/are: headache for the last 5ish days, only occasionally helped by excedrin, but pretty much nonstop and worse in the morning, persistent sore throat with no accompanying mucus or sinus congestion, a general feeling of malaise/fatigue (like the feeling you get when you're sick or after a day of working out and it feels like your body weighs 10x as much as it should and it's so much effort to even move). Fever started about 4 days after the above, and since then it's been off and on, likely due to the excedrin keeping it down. Highest fever was 100.9, but it's staying right around 99.3ish between doses of excedrin. Now I have tightness in the chest and an occasional dry cough. Started OTC mucinex last night per doctor's orders.

Hopefully my story can help those that aren't being very smart about this whole thing realize the effects they could be having on others. 
----------

This is probably going to be long, and I fear those of you that need to read it, won't. I hope that this gives some perspective to those who have been lucky enough so far that you or your loved ones have not been directly affected by this pandemic.

[Husband] and I have been following a strict quarantine since March as his father is high risk and we wanted to make sure that if something happened, it would be safe for us to visit him. We made an emergency trip to Kansas about 2 weeks ago to help care for him. Both ways we only stopped when we absolutely had to: once for gas and once for a bathroom break. We wore masks, carried hand sanitizer, washed our hands at every opportunity and were as careful as possible. At every stop in Oklahoma and Kansas we were openly mocked for wearing masks.

One of those stops we ran into a travel center for a bathroom break and no one inside was wearing a mask. We got some looks as we walked in, but whatever, right?

When I came out of the bathroom stall there was a woman who gave me a dirty look and scoffed. The sinks on that side were in use, so I walked around the wall (social distancing!) to use an empty sink. This woman walked around to follow me (the opposite direction of the exit) and did an exaggerated fake cough RIGHT IN MY FACE.

I am by no means a violent person, but I have never once wanted to beat the shit out of someone so badly. And if I could have without violating social distance protocols and putting my family more at risk, I might have done it.

That was 12 days ago. 

This week I've had a few symptoms that I chalked up to allergies...but then yesterday afternoon I spiked a fever above 100.4. I spent hours on the phone trying to find a place that would test me yesterday or this weekend, to no avail. My primary doctor will be testing me on Monday. 

But until I get a negative result, not only am I keeping a strict quarantine, but it also means that because [husband] lives with me and has been potentially exposed, neither of us can help care for his dad. He has dementia among other health issues, and any time that we can spend with him right now is a blessing because like all of us, no one can guarantee tomorrow. This selfish, awful person who coughed in my face (or any of the selfish assholes not wearing a mask) may have robbed my husband of the last chance to be with his father. I really hope that isn't the case, but the fact that it's even a possibility right now makes me livid. 

I have had several friends lose loved ones directly due to COVID-19. I've had others who have lost family members for reasons completely unrelated to COVID-19 who either didn't get to say goodbye at all or could only do so due to a video call and a kind nurse. My own sister is a nurse who has worked in ICUs in one of the hardest hit areas early on in the pandemic and not a day goes by that I don't worry about her safety.

Your actions have real consequences, people. If you claim to care about your freedoms being infringed because you're asked to wear a cloth face covering to protect others, if you claim this is a hoax or whatever bullshit conspiracy theories you've picked up from scholarly sources such as YouTube, if you whine about needing a haircut or wanting to go to a bar....Fuck you. 

And if you claim to love thy neighbor and don't wear a mask when you go out, you are a hypocrite of the highest order and I hope the hottest places in whatever hell you believe in are reserved for you and those like you.

Because for once, this isn't about you. It's about all of us. 

So suck it up, buttercup, wear a fucking mask or stay the fuck home.",2020-06-29 21:04:57
228,"My dad's anxiety is truly going to be the thing that gets him, not covid, I don't know what to do",36,hhy1zx,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hhy1zx/my_dads_anxiety_is_truly_going_to_be_the_thing/,16,"My father is incredibly concerned about getting COVID 19. He's in his 60s and has asthma. While I believe that he *is* vulnerable and our household should do everything that we can to protect him, I also think that there are some elements of this fear that are going to the extreme and maybe even becoming more detrimental to his health than the actual disease ever would be.

Since the beginning, we have been on *extreme* lockdown. Grocery delivery. No seeing friends at all. Not bringing the dog to the dog sitter because there's a teeny chance that he could become a vector too. No takeout food. My dad is the only one to do any kind of errand like getting gas because he believes that he's the only one who can do it safely and correctly. Instead of just waiting for three days to open mail, or opening it and then washing our hands - he waits for three days, opens it, sanitizes it, and then places the product in a UV chamber that he built for another one or two days.

I'm trying to be understanding, I don't want him to be this scared, and I don't want to lose my dad... so my mom and I have just tried to suck it up and be incredibly careful.

This has been really hard for me for a number of reasons, and this is a much longer story, but I don't actually live with my parents. I live overseas with my husband and got stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time when all of these things started happening. So I've been in my parents' home. I haven't seen my husband or my friends in months. It's incredibly hard. In this country, I also have friends who want to do things like go on socially distanced walks who I have to say no to because my dad is uncomfortable. 

I've been in the camp for a while that we need to cater to whoever has the greatest amount of anxiety in the household - my father - and do whatever we can to make them more comfortable. However, it's getting to a point - I just made a different post about an appointment that I have if you want to see a specific circumstance, but I'm realizing that my dad's anxiety is a much larger issue.

He has always been depressed and anxious. He doesn't have any friends so not seeing people hasn't been a real issue for him. He hates going to work so working from home hasn't been... bad... but it hasn't made him any happier because he's still depressed.

He's stopped going outside. He goes between the room that he's set up for his office and the room that he sleeps in - he and my mother haven't slept in the same bedroom for my whole life - and only comes downstairs like twice a day for coffee and food. Prior to this he was on a healthy diet and exercise plan but has since slipped back into eating white bread and drinking soda. He's taking a vitamin D supplement but how good is that really if he refuses to go outdoors at all. 

The amount of stress and anxiety that he has is extreme. He spends most of his weekends laying in bed. There was one week when my mom and I went to our beach house to get away - we did not come into contact with anyone, but he still didn't trust us when we came home and made us all wear masks for two weeks. He wouldn't stand in the same room as us and he would literally jump or flinch every time he saw either of us.

Whenever a neighbor comes by to speak to my mother from a distance, with a mask on, he stands at the window monitoring the situation to make sure that he knows they were at an acceptable distance.

This is the kind of stress that kills you. Yes, I think that if he got COVID he could possibly be severely ill - but not because he was ever predisposed to this disease - but because of his mental state and his physical state that has resulted from it. I know that you can't just stop being like this - I've seen this sort of thing from him for my whole life - but there are literally so many studies about how this affects your immune system. He's acting like he's going to get it, and going to die from it - whereas if he acted like he wasn't going to get it, and wasn't going to die from it, he probably wouldn't! 

Again, I believe that we need to take the precautions that we need to in order to protect him - however, it isn't fair from him to descend into the depths of this mental illness and still govern everything that my mother and I do, as the law only gets more and more extreme to suit the state that he is putting himself in. Instead of getting help or at least taking steps that are proven to improve his condition, like going outside for just 20 minutes a day. He is making himself more vulnerable. Creating the need for us to be more and more careful. It's starting to do in my mental and emotional health as well given that my circumstance hasn't been easy either. 

I don't want to blame him - but you see what I mean? I'm at a total loss. My mother feels like she can't talk to him. I don't feel like I can either. But the level that he's at is dangerous for his health.",2020-06-29 15:19:46

I volunteer at a zoo, and as you can probably guess my role was put on hold due to COVID. In the UK where I live zoos started to be able to reopen from the 15th June and last weekend I was told I could come back to my voluntary role this weekend.

I'm very glad to be able to do this as I've missed my role desperately. The zoo has all it's safety measures in place and honestly I feel I'm at a lot less risk being out in the open air at a zoo then I would be going back to my retail job. 

Might feel a bit weird as I've not been very active during lockdown so hopefully I don't get too tired out, and having to get back into physical work might be a bit of a pain. It's also probably going to be a bit weird actually being around people for the first time in months since the only people I've seen are my family, neighbors and shop workers (Also hoping I don't get a sensory overload episode)",2020-06-29 20:16:37
231,Tested positive for IgM antibodies today 🥺,5,hi7b4r,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hi7b4r/tested_positive_for_igm_antibodies_today/,4,"Hey there, I had found out on Saturday that a friend I had contact with tested positive and didn’t tell me they were being tested despite me asking them before hanging out recently. Let’s just say that person has a lot of explaining to do. 

So I went this morning to get a rapid antibody test and found I tested positive for IgM antibodies. I followed up with a nasal swab test and will get results in 2 days. 

I have no symptoms and feel great. It’s been 7 days since first possible exposure, and 5 since the last exposure with this person. 

I am extremely nervous for my family as they are at high risk due to one being diabetic, one with heart problems, and another with bad asthma. 

I’m doing everything I can to try to distance myself within the home, but what I’d like to ask is should I have my family get tested since they are so vulnerable. 

TLDR- exposed 5-7 days ago, IgM antibodies, and awaiting nasal swab test. should I have my family get tested since they are high risk? 

Thanks fam",2020-06-29 23:53:57

Hello all, I was asking people if they can help me answer some questions with thier personal take or experience.... what has your recovery been like? And do you still have some after effects from the virus.? My aunt got sick back in March with the virus.. shortness of breath and loss of taste and we all got exposed. What’s weird is that we didn’t get sick including my uncle who’s diabetic. And roll around April my father got sick... fever, chills, sore throat, cough, fatigue, headaches.... he is recovered although he has some few coughs. Just want to hear your experience and thoughts from this. Also we all tested for antibodies and my aunt was the only one that came back positive..",2020-06-30 01:44:09

She can always wear her mask, but we all know that is not really how masks efficacy works. She is allowed to work from home part-time throughout the week....for now.

We've contemplated her quitting her job, since we're also self employed and we can easily be isolated and safe (our business income is the primary)...but then we give up our health insurance, which is REALLY good. And just because she doesn't go into work, doesn't mean we won't contract it some way or another. And there could not be a more terrible time to get caught without health insurance.

Granted, we're in Northern AZ, which it's relatively calm...but that doesn't mean much to me, nor does it mean it will stay that way.

Mostly just posting this because I need to vent. We're so conflicted. I want to suggest she just quit, but again, if it's for fear of contracting COVID, it's just as likely to happen at the store as it is at her office. And if we do get it, I'd like to know that surviving it doesn't also mean a potentially catastrophic medical bill waiting for us at the other end.",2020-06-29 23:33:15

My mother had symptoms that she gave to me in March and April, and she recovered and tested positive for antibodies. My father, however, has had no symptoms and is antibody negative.

Now, with lockdown restrictions easing and my family bored, my dad wants me and him to go on a trip to Paris through the Eurotunnel in the middle of July. My dad is in a high-risk group - he's over 60, he's overweight and diabetic, and he's a chest physician. My mother and I have tried over and over to convince him not to go. He says that if I don't want to go, he'll go by himself, but it's him I'm worried about, not myself.

I've tried telling him that the lockdown relaxations are against the advice of scientists. He replied that the government wouldn't allow for travel between Britain and France if it weren't safe and that France hasn't had a major COVID problem like Britain. He also says that he encounters more COVID positive patients at work than we're likely to meet in Paris.

However, he was still working a week ago, probably in contact with some students from the same year as my partner (although with measurements such as a mask and physical distancing). A few days after that he began developing symptoms, I think.
I'm really worried now because I really want to keep Covid out of this house. But my partner won't be able to self-isolate as we live together.

They forced me to go to a christian highschool where teachers taught being gay was not only a sin, but either a depraved choice or result of mental illness. I'm now in a progressive college and my friends are all either LGBT themselves, or allies. But I still had to deal with internalized self-hatred and homophobia. It took me two years of college to come out. That was around the middle of last year, and it went great, my parents came to terms with it and my friends didn't care (in a good way). 

I still needed to take it slow with dating because of my complete lack of experience. The most I did last year was kiss random strangers at bars (this included my first kiss). Nothing close to serious. And don't get me wrong, it was fun and I miss it, but it is not what I truly want. I want a relationship, someone to hold hands with, cook dinner for, plan cute elaborate dates... I've never had that. I'm not perfect but I feel like I'd be a good partner.

But I wasn't ready last year. I needed to go to therapy, and I did. I worked on myself for months untill I felt I was ready to start dating. And then we had our first confirmed case of covid. My country's situation was looking good but cases have spiked and it's worsening. Authorities are now worried about health systems collapsing like in other places. Obviously staying safe is the priority so it seems like I won't be able to date for at least a year, maybe more. And I'm having a hard time dealing with that. I had already waited so long, and now not only do I have to wait longer, but feel even lonelier since I can't even see my friends or go clubbing. I miss physical contact.

And I'm seeing people who I matched with back in march, who I had good connections with, getting into relationships recently. This after I declined meeting in person and texting slowed down. I feel like I'm missing good chances at finding a partner because of this. I've considered virtual dating, but I already don't know how to date normally, and now I can't really on my friends' advice because none of them have experience dating during a pandemic (shocking, I know /s). Btw, if any of you have been dating while staying safe, I'd be grateful to hear about your experiences.

And I know this is a small problem to have considering the circumstances, which makes me feel even more shitty for complaining. But man, I'm lonely.

I'm cautious of saying that this is good news because I'm not sure that's an accurate description of 25,000 people needing somewhere to help cope with their anxieties and fears but hopefully having a space where you can come has been good news for all of you when you've felt you've needed it. An advantage of the sub growing so large is that someone, somewhere in the world (including the moderators) is likely to be online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, if and when you need someone to talk to. 

When we started this sub in February - after realising that questions about personal circumstances and fears were often removed from r/coronavirus because they weren't really right for that sub but that there was nowhere else for the people who posted them to go - no-one could know for sure how the pandemic would play out. There was a long way to go, and things were likely to appear to get worse before they got better. People needed somewhere that wouldn't sensationalise the bad news; would seek out the good (because there always was good news, somewhere); could offer advice based on the best available information and explain why that often changes; and just be a shoulder to cry on if people needed it. One of the best achievements of this sub is seeing how well you support and be there for one another, over and over and over again.

As we continue, more and more countries are getting over the worst of the pandemic and starting to return to something like normal.

241,Going to get a laser treatment for my face - my father doesn't want me to go - what is the right thing to do?,2,hhxmbo,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hhxmbo/going_to_get_a_laser_treatment_for_my_face_my/,2,"So for some context - I'm 24 and I have been in my parents' home since this all began. Not because I live here, I actually live with my husband overseas, I just had some bad luck and was in the wrong place at the wrong time when things closed down. So there's a lot going on for me - I haven't seen my husband in months, I haven't seen my friends, I haven't had my life, I'm trying to just cope with the way things are right now.

I have been extremely careful. My parents are both in their 60s and my dad has asthma... he also has severe anxiety and depression and hasn't handled any of this well. I don't blame him, it's scary, and any amount of caution that can be taken should be. However, the extremes he's taken may be... a little much. Like, instead of just letting a package or mail sit for three days and then opening it, or just opening it and washing your hands and the product after - he lets it sit for three days, washes it, and then lets the item sit under a UV light for an entire additional day before any of us are allowed to have what we ordered.

He's had anger / anxiety fits multiple times when he's seen my mom come too close to a neighbor who has come over to talk to her from across the yard while they both have masks on.

The thing is, we need to protect him - but I am certain that he is making it worse for himself as well.

We are on the east coast of the US and I would say the area that we're in isn't that badly affected.

I have been religious about my actions and how careful I am to make him more comfortable - but it's making me extremely depressed. My father doesn't have any friends or social life so not seeing people is a normal thing for him - for me, it's doing a number on my emotional and physical health.

**Now getting to the current issue.**

**At the beginning of the year, I had a battle with severe acne.** This was devastating for me. It was hard emotionally and physically. It took a long time for me to get it under wraps, but **I was overjoyed when I found a number of things that actually worked for me. One of them was a mild laser treatment.** I was getting this treatment monthly in a series of 5 and was unable to finish the series due to lockdowns. **The clinic is opening back up again and they scheduled me for an appointment. This is not a spa, it's a plastic surgeon's office - not connected to a doctor's office - it's their outpatient center.** They're taking precautions of their own - they don't allow more than one client in the building at a time. They call you when you're allowed to come in. They wear masks and you have to wear a mask. They're only taking cards. I got the first appointment of the day so it should be clean. **The only thing is that it's a 20 minute session where I will not be wearing a mask.** Because my family has been on super lockdown - I do not have the virus. I haven't seen anyone or come into contact with anything. **The nurse ALWAYS wears a mask and gloves during this procedure even before covid - I'm assuming she'll be wearing even more protection at this time.** The office called me prior to do a full background check of where I've been in the past 30 days. They're being very careful.

**With all of those things considered - it should be fine. Especially since the nurse will be wearing a mask - that would protect me. My father's anxiety is off the rails and I don't think that he even understands proper mask-wearing at this point and thinks that wearing one will protect him.**

**I have been doing everything imaginable to protect my father and wouldn't do something that I think would pose a significant risk. He has already banned my mom and I from seeing anyone - it's hard not to feel like a prisoner in this home.**

**Due to the stress - I'm breaking out again - which is an additional emotional stressor for me (caused by emotional stress) because of how bad it was before and how difficult it was to solve.**

**I need this treatment.** But my dad has been having a panic attack about my going since last night when my mother told him that I had an appointment. To be honest, I wasn't going to tell him in the first place, I was just going to go, and then continue to be respectful and careful in our own home as I have been.

I do understand that we're opening too early - but our household is being too strict. It's wrecking my mental health and therefore my skin - which I've worked so hard to fix. I'm a 24 year old woman, married, haven't seen my husband in months, haven't seen my friends, and now I'm starting to feel even sadder about this skin issue that I know I have a solution for - this appointment.

&#x200B;

**What do I do? Do I ignore my dad's feelings this one time to get something I need done? Or do I cancel and live in this hole that he wants our whole family to be in?**

EDIT: To add, I know others who are being safe and have gone to the dentist for cleanings recently - that's arguably far riskier than what I'm doing. Those offices are taking their own precautions as well.. and it seems to be working... the numbers for our state are really quite low.",2020-06-29 14:43:37

I am not sure if colleges will punish us for taking the semester off but I could not imagine how this will be safe, enjoyable or worth the price/education. Most of my classes will be online and we have a very overcrowded living situation at my college (residential all four years). I have a job and I am thinking of deciding to withdraw for a semester (not sure if I will be financially punished) and renting a cheap apt in my city with another friend planning to withdraw. I am depressed with the current situation and although my area is doing alright (upper Midwest) I am scared of what college will be like.

I have OCD and depression but I am motivated in school work, however, the current changes are making me feel very down. I’m so sad about missing out on college. They say it is impossible to withdraw and just go back and also that I won’t be able to go back. I am not sure that is true..

My dad works from home and is still getting his full salary, so my family are in a relatively stable spot. I've always been more of a homebody, so the past 3 months have been mostly me staying inside playing video games. 

That said, I'm tired of the lockdown. I'm tired of being lectured by people on Twitter and Reddit about how I just want to kill Grandma to hang out with some friends. I'm tired of hearing statistic after statistic of cases going up and how we need to shut down again.  

I missed seeing my friends during this pandemic, and Discord and zoom can only provide so much companionship. My church has been hosting in person Bible studies for about two weeks, and I love it. My friends and I have been meeting for movie nights and it feels so good to be with people other than my family. For a while, it seemed things would be going back to normal. Even if it meant having to adjust to the ""new normal"" of wearing masks and keeping a distance, I was ready to have a life again.

But now, it looks like that'll come to an end. People are panicking again, demanding to go back into lockdown, and demanding that people who don't comply be fined or even arrested. I even saw someone on Twitter threatening to pepper spray anyone who comes near them without wearing a mask. It feels like I was given 2 weeks of freedom only to be forced back in my cell. 

I know why the lockdown was necessary. I understand why people panicked and shut everything down. I understand that it's not about me, and that ""this too will pass."" But is it too much to ask for some semblance of normalcy? Is it too much to ask to see my friends and eat a burger without being lectured about how I'm going to kill everyone?

Any assurance or advice would be very helpful. Thank you so much !

I live in Bangladesh, South Asia. I went out to an office (due to necessity, I only went out 4-5 times throughout the last 3-4 months). It was a closed space with only a door open. There were two people and one of them was without any mask (on the table). I was too afraid/polite to say anything and had to sit beside him for a few minutes (4 minutes I guess). Then he wore the mask. But -

* this guy most likely is unaware of germs and how they spread (most people in the country and especially that area are like that, most are illiterate, don't practise social distancing, don't wear mask to protect others etc.)..
* This guy deals with all floors of these unaware people.
* I read that people NOT ONLY SPREAD IT THROUGH SNEEZING/COUGHING, but also through SPEAKING, BREATHING. I even found an article saying it only takes 50 minutes to infect someone else through breathing and 5-10 mins if all particles from talking were inhaled (take it w/ a grain of salt please). So he could have been breathing and talking in that small, closed room for 30 mins or even an hour.
* **I sat within 2-2.5 feet beside/angled towards him, he talked for 3-4 mins in other direction (not loudly), then he wore the mask and i had to stay another 7-10 mins in that space.**
* i KNOW I AM A STUPID. SHOULD HAVE SAID PUT IT ON AND SHOULD HAVE MAINTAINED DISTANCE. No need to call me out on that .....     :(
* I had to go through a few others as well (crowded footpaths) who were talking loudly and not wearing masks.
* I was wearing a surgical (could be fake ones) and another cheap one (fabric type) (later found out it was probably worn out on some parts)....i even shut out the gaps with paper towels. But my eyes were unprotected.

I am afraid because my mom has diabetes and very poor health (50 y/o). I am afraid that I may infect her and my other family members. I asked my doctor relative and he said it will be good to take precautions given the circumstances (mask + handwashing). But I think (sorry, not self-diagnosing, just feels like that) I have contamination OCD and it feels like I can't get rid of germ traces. (pillow where i sleep - touching it later, others handling the utensils, breathing inside the house for days, talking to someone masklessly.)

&#x200B;

I need someone to tell me -

* if that was indeed a risky encounter and i should take precautions.
* where is the line for being obsessive and being cautious?

&#x200B;

If possible I would like to give up all these hourly handwashing if I touch my face, what is touching what, etc...I can't relax like this. Please help.

&#x200B;

It's not just the possibility of catching something, but how should I act  indoors? Wearing mask might help me keep my aerosols/breaths to myself? Is that needed?

&#x200B;

**tl:dr; Sat within 2.5 feet of a guy without mask for 4 minutes (wore mask then another 10 mins) - who is likely unaware like the people he has to interact with - in that area (assistant of the landlord of a multi-storeyed building). People who live there roam masklessly and are largely underprivileged and illiterate (don't want to stereotype but true). It was a closed space. Afraid of infecting family members now and what should I do?**

My counselor said it is normal and okay for me to be too scared to go back to work in a public place during a pandemic. She is looking into extending my unemployment. She said they have unemployment set aside for this reason.

My father is 72, diabetic, and the primary caregiver to my mother with an autoimmune disorder.

Since this pandemic began, I have offered to go shopping for any food and supplies he may need. He took me up on this at first, but after the first delivery I did for him he did not contact me with further requests. On a phone call with him, he told me he was still going out for groceries, albeit, he said, in the early hours where the stores were only allowing seniors in. I again requested he ask me to shop for him, and he agreed.

I continued to not receive requests from him. During this time, my sister had contacted him father several times, offering to pay for grocery delivery service, which he would not commit to.

I had another conversation with him, urging him not to go out and inquiring about my sister's requests to pay for grocery delivery. He claimed to not remember my sister bringing this up at all (this is where I began to suspect he was not being entirely honest with me). We got him to agree to pick a delivery service and commit to placing an order.

Last week, I remembered the security software I had previously installed on his phone, to help us recover it in the event it was lost (he has lost his phone a few times in the past). The app allows me to see his location, and I was able to see that he was shopping at a local grocery store for an hour early that morning. 

I called him later in the day and asked if he'd placed his first delivery order yet. He had not. Then I asked him if he'd been out shopping, or went out anywhere at all. He said he had not, even though I knew he went shopping that morning.

Now neither my sister nor I can trust what he says. Is there ANY way we can get him to stay home?? We can't tell him that we know he lied about going to the grocery store that morning, or he'll know that I was able to see his location, and he may just stop communicating at all. 

All the more frustrating is the fact that on the surface he seems to be taking this virus seriously. He wears a mask when he goes out (although I explained how that does more to protect others than himself). He keeps updated on the current status of the virus and occasionally sends me links to safety videos. 

I am worried about my parents' health and safety. Does anyone have any advice?

254,Worked Out Wearing a Mask Today,43,hh4603,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hh4603/worked_out_wearing_a_mask_today/,16,"Went to the gym, our governor said starting today all public spaces require masks, and businesses are mandated to enforce mask wearing.  Gyms are iffy.  Basically no one forcing masks inside gyms.  I figured, whatever... I’ll give it a try.  We wear masks sometimes... and I’ve worn them on and off my whole life living abroad.  

First I ran on the treadmill.  I did sprint intervals for 30 min.  1 min@11mph, then 1min@6mph... on and off for half hour.  Then I did a light jog at 6mph for 10 min.  today was shoulders and leg day.  Typical medium lifting for about 1 hour (I do actually stop to check my phone now and then).  Mask the whole time.  

Did it bother me?  Yeah... it was digging into my ears a bit.  With my headphones and the mask around the ear... a bit snug.... 

but other than that.... nope.  

I also noticed... no one in the gym wore a mask.  Besides me.  At first, I felt a bit ... self conscious?  Why am I the only one wearing?

The next phase - I started thinking - “well, mask doesn’t protect me- it protects others... and I’m not sick... and they def not gonna protect me if they sick.... so F- it... I should take it off.”

I was THIS close..... but something stirred inside me.  I noticed every person I passed... they looked at me.  Some of them,  I imagine had thoughts like “this sheep is a conformist... .listening to whatever the government tells him to do”

Something irked me.  I’m the ONLY. One wearing a mask... and I’m the conformist?  I’m the only one that took a step considering my community.... and because they look at me funny... I’m suddenly about to say “meh, fuck the community... die everybody! Cough on you!”?  Really?  For a few stares, I’m gonna give up my values that easy?  Am I that weak?  That lacking of conviction?

Then I realized something.  These people that refuse to wear, cause this mask is a shackle... a prison to enslave you by the government.... Why do you wear pants?  Why do you wear a shirt in public?  Why do you check if your fly is zipped and your cock isn’t hanging out when you exit the bathroom?  Cause you followed some government official telling you not to.  You listened to “the man” telling you it’s NOT ok to walk around with your private parts showing to the world.... yet somehow... THIS piece of cloth/paper on your face is a torture device?  Your family jewels are contained daily in a prison... yet THIS thing that will likely be only a few months of your life... is a prison sentence?  Oh, you can’t breathe cause you have a “medical” condition?  Are you THAT weak?  Is this country so weakened and crippled that you can’t come together as a community to care for each other.... to unite... and above all that you have the lung capacity of an asthmatic baby?  Well then... yeah.... maybe this country deserves to fall.  

So yeah.  I kept the mask on.  I don’t need to. No one else is wearing it at my gym.  No one cares.  fuck you.  I care.  God willing, I’m young (ish) and healthy... no family other than my loving wife (who’s even healthier than me).... knock on wood... I may get sick.. and die after I post this... but.... my current mood is.... I’m healthy and I likely don’t need to fear the Coof.... but fuck you. I care.  This country I came to be a part of... is screaming for help.  At every corner we need unity... not division.  This government, which I swore allegiance to when I became a citizen.... has asked for my help to just fucking wear a mask... something that doesn’t cause me any pain or suffering or discomfort... cause obviously I’m stronger than most of the locals here.... so yeah.  I’m gonna wear this mask.  Even when I run.  

Listen, while I understand the term “mandate” is a bit scary... and until the military comes to put a muzzle on all our faces at gunpoint (which will never happen) - or we all unanimously agree one way or the other (again, never).... the reality is... some choose to wear... others choose not to wear.  You, who only wanted to open the economy up - as long as it was “easy and convenient” for you... choose not to wear.  You only cared for the economy as long as it didn’t involve you actually making a sacrifice for your fellow man.  Just call it like it is. It’s your right. 

But, STOP, touting “masks don’t do this” or “don’t help” that.  For every medical bullshit fact you can throw, there’s another fact that can be thrown right back at you.  So just stop.  You just choose to not do what the majority of Americans have worked hard to do for their fellow neighbor to get this country started again.  And that’s ok.  Just call it what it is  - you just don’t care.  

When I choose to help my community, and do something that we, the people, for the people, and by the people have asked each other to do - to help each other out - in this nation - when I do this thing - that harms NO ONE - but maybe helps someone out... when I’m actively sacrificing for what i believe might HELP my community and start the economy - and you choose not to.... well that makes me more an American than you.  

(That being said.... I do understand a mask at the gym is a bit overkill.... )

One aunt hadn’t been feeling the best and wore a mask for most of the time (except for when we ate but during that I was across from her at the table so I’m assuming less than 6ft) and I wore a mask for some of that time and again not while I ate. Overall I feel like I was less than 6ft from her so I’m more concerned. I didn’t think much of it until yesterday when I got a decently bad headache in the morning. I was fine after a while but late in the afternoon I started to feel more stomach pain which I assumed was from making food earlier that I don’t usually eat. It got worse as the night went on and I had boba which usually does upset my stomach so I also thought that might be a factor. I’ve also had muscle pains in my lower back and thighs for about two days now which I initially attributed to working out/“that time of the month” but now I’m not so sure. Later in the night I also for a really bad headache and felt kind of lightheaded/dizzy. It is currently the next day and I still have a pretty bad headache and stomach pain which is concerning. I’m pretty sure I have gastritis so not sure how much an impact that has or if I do have COVID how much of an impact that will also have on me. I’m just kind of scared in general because of these pains.

I haven’t been able to sleep well and I am worried about transferring it to others. My aunt is getting testing today and will get results in 2-4 days. Not sure if being nervous is what’s making me have some of these symptoms. If it’s positive I feel like I might be too. I guess overall I’m wondering if others have had similar symptoms or can give me advice because I’m not so sure what is happening/ what to do and it’s taking a mental/ physical toll on me.

Maybe 10 cases total in greater region. No deaths. We have a very small hospital though (25 beds).

Last night when I went to bed, I started coughing. I attributed it to GERD. I sometimes get a cough at night when I lie down, particularly if I’ve eaten or had something to drink close to bedtime. (Which I did). I took two tums, sat up for 30 minutes, and it got better. (I had a similar bout about 4 days ago)

Today, I gradually noticed a tickle in my throat, growing worse. By nighttime, I was coughing off and on, pretty regularly. Deep breaths are what trigger it. It’s not constant, but fairly consistent. 

There’s a fair amount of pollen out and our windows are all open bc of mild temps. Also it’s very dry and, as a result, kind of dusty out. My partner recommended I take allergy meds. Took a Benadryl and two tums. Seems to be getting better, but I’m still a little freaked. 

My exposure to other people outside partner and two kids has been pretty limited and I wear a mask almost always (noted a few weird instances below). 

Recent exposure to people outside of household in late week or so: I was In a grocery store (masked) 1 week ago for about 5-10 minutes. Landlord showed our house to a prospective tenant (they were masked) on Thursday. Went through a house last week with our landlord (he just wanted to show us this rental he owned bc it’s an old house and we are into old houses) and didn’t even think about the fact that we didn’t wear masks. (We were distanced, but I think the low numbers where we live have kind of lulled me into a sense of safety.) And yesterday moving company rep came through my house. He wore a mask but, stupidly, I didn’t put one on. He also took his off in our garage because it was very hot. And daughter went to drugstore a week ago with friend (they were out for socially distanced walk) and didn’t wear a mask. 

I’m feeling angry with myself for being less vigilant, and I’m worried I could be sick. (I also suffer from an anxiety disorder and medical issues are a huge trigger for me.). Any words of advice or comfort appreciated.  

Oh, no other symptoms. Temp normal. Oxygen levels between 95-99 all day. 

TL;DR started coughing over last day. Live in place with very low numbers and almost always mask when I’m out (which isn’t very often) but forgot a few times in last week. Could be allergies or GERD but not sure. Just worried.",2020-06-28 15:43:23

Problem is: mom gets baptised tomorrow. Something she's very excited about and was super happy that I'd be here to see. I'm fine with going, or I was for a bit.

The most scary thing though, is that over the course of today, I've just been feeling a bit out of sorts. I am by no means seriously ill, and I feel like I'm either being overly cautious, but I'm worried it will deteriorate. I have never considered death as seriously as I have done in the past couple of days. I had a near death experience when I was a kid, but that was something that I recovered from due to the brilliant work of the NHS. I worry that if I get this, the only thing that can save me is my own body. I worry that I will end up alone in hospital, and could potentially die there and just become another statistic. People keep talking about how things will go back to normal, and how a vaccine could be around within the next 12 months, but I worry that I might not make it to the other side of this, especially as there's other stories saying that there won't be a cure, and it's basically going to be a case of shielding people having minimal outside time indefinitely, like we are a leper colony.

But then the other side of me just says I'm 29, and aside from this medication, I am mostly healthy. When I get flu, it takes me out of action for a day or two, then I'm back to normal. I just don't know what to think. If I know for certain that I'd recover from it, I would be more optimistic, but it's that uncertainty that is causing me huge amounts of stress.",2020-06-28 04:24:57
264,been missing out as a disabled person for a long time,6,hh2bwm,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hh2bwm/been_missing_out_as_a_disabled_person_for_a_long/,6,"Hey Just wanted to post here because I'm feeling overwhelmed and angry at the state of things.

I graduated from high school two years ago, high school was a really awful time, so awful that I took my final year online, which was great but isolating, especially because I can't drive due to my vision, so I essentially can't leave the house on my own. Then I had to take a gap year because of unforseen circumstances, yet another year almost entirely spent in my house, taking care of an elderly dog and dealing with my dad being an alcoholic asshole, then I finally was abe to go to college and it was a really bad fit due to the location and accessibility issues, if I wanted to transfer I needed to take CC classes, so I came home for spring semester and was just trying to power through the days of online classes (my classes were always onine) 

I got accepted to my dream school which was awesome but due to my college going mostly online I decided to defer because the price just isn't worth it, I'm so alone all the time, I'll be 21 years old and a freshman because of the transfer when I start, due to corona I'll probably spend this next year mostly inside too, it's just my room day in and day out, I went to VA beach with a friend, the first person I've seen outside my home in four months, and I feel guilty because almost no one else was wearing a mask or social distancing when we were walking around the shops.

For five years now I've had exactly one friend, failed to start college, been horribly alone, and corona has just cut off any support lines I had, It's just too much. I don't know how I'm going to get through the next year, assuming things are even better by then. I've beeb looking forward to being able to start having a life and being at school and It feels like everytime I get close to something getting better it falls through.",2020-06-28 01:52:18

I came home to live with my family in March. Lately, I feel like I don't have things to look forward to. Every day feels the same. It's impossible to mix things up because I can't drive and my family members are extremely strict about social distancing. The oldest is 57 and none of us have pre-existing conditions. Although my state is gradually reopening, my family remains at home 95% of the time. We occasionally go out for walks on our block. Once a week, we go for drives around the neighborhood, and we only get out of the car if we see a small park with no one in it. Beaches and restaurants are out of the question.

 I feel like all around me, people are gradually returning to real life - whether it's the people I see outside during our drives, or friends posting on social media who have gone back to dining out, seeing friends, and even traveling by plane. I don't want to throw caution to the wind, but I also don't think it's sustainable to live the way I am now. It occurred to me recently that my life won't feel normal again until January 2021 at the earliest, and that made me feel really sad.",2020-06-28 03:49:25

Cases don’t seem to be going down anytime soon, and it seems like it would be safer to go before it’s infected and affects my immune system. However, I also have a couple risk factors that make me extra anxious about getting COVID-19. 

My dentist said they can get me in as the first appointment on a Monday, so there wouldn’t be any aerosol from other patients. They also said they use N95s and face shields. They do not, however, use the vacuums many use to suck any particles next to the patients face. 

My concern is that, while case numbers are low in my county (55 active), people (including nurses, etc.) haven’t been adhering to distancing this whole time. I’ll see Snap stories of them at house parties, going to Vegas, etc. My dentist said nobody is allowed to leave the county and come to work without quarantine, but idk how they enforce that with the more youthful staff. 

What are the odds that an asymptomatic dentist or assistant could spread to me through PPE while my mouth is open? I’ve been cancelling my appointment for two weeks but I’m not sure how long I can keep doing it.

274,Recovering from COVID-19 (65 years old),169,hg5om6,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hg5om6/recovering_from_covid19_65_years_old/,59,"I’ve had anxiety issues since childhood, and it was getting out of my control with the emergence of COVID-19. Being in my 60’s, I was convinced that COVID-19 would be my death sentence. Here is my story of getting sick, testing positive and recovery.

With anxiety and seasonal allergies, every post-nasal drip or cough had me convinced I had the virus, and I began taking my temperature anytime I even twitched. I did learn that my normal ranged between 97.4-97.8.

We followed all advice with the virus emergence. Husband and I stayed in lockdown, had groceries delivered etc. I am retired, but spouse started working from home in mid-March. To be safe, we cleaned/disinfected everything that came into the house, or let it sit in the garage for a few days.

I did bike outside, and husband is an avid runner, so those activities continued, but we both kept a safe distance from all other people.

For the record. I was already taking multi-vitamin and Vit D3 supplements. My calcium/Vit D levels were tested in January as part of my routine bone density screening, and Vit D levels were just below the low end of the desirable range, so I started the D3 back then.

In early June I had to go to the dentist. I was having a bad toothache in one of my crowned teeth, and after a week of hoping it would go away (it didn’t), the crown fell off. My dentist had good practices in place:  They wore appropriate PPE, wiped down chair before I got in it, pre-screened patients, had patients wait in car until staff was ready.  Long story short, decay under old crown was fixed, and new crown placed. I sanitized my hands when I left that office before getting into my car.

6 days later… I started feeling sick.

Day 0 afternoon. Started feeling unwell, just overall sick and weak, and with a bad headache and belly pain. Went to bed in the afternoon. No trouble breathing, no loss of sense of smell or taste. Temperature slightly elevated.

Day 1. Woke up feeling miserable with bad belly pain and headache and overall ache. Stayed in bed most of day, getting up only for bathroom and forcing myself to stay hydrated by drinking a lot of water. Convinced self I had a food-borne illness. Temperature was in the upper 100’s.

Day 2. Worse than Day 1, fever up to 101.9. No trouble breathing but did have a sense of being out of breath. Called doctor. Doctor told me to get tested, rest, take acetaminophen, and stay hydrated.   EDIT:  Adding that I was tested on this day.

Days 3 to 5. The worst days. Temperature hit 102.0, and overall feeling awful.  EDIT:  Adding that I received positive result on Day 4.

Day 6. Temperature never exceeded 100.3. Ate some real food but spent most of day reclined and dozing. By evening, I felt well enough to go to my desk and check email.

Day 7. One step forward, 2 steps back. Temperature up to 101.4. Felt like I had brain fog, out of breath, and overall sick. Anxiety flared and I was convinced that I was getting worse and would have to go to hospital.

Day 8. This day was like a repeat of Day 6. Doctor advised that this type of feeling better, then feeling worse was not unusual.

Day 9. An up and down day. I’d start to feel better, then get brain fog sick feeling, sleep for a few hours, feel better, then feel bad again. Fever hanging in the upper 100’s, still feeling out of breath.

Day 10. Temperature never exceeded 98.1. Able to sit at computer for a while. Feeling much better, although still feel very weak and drained.

Day 11. The first day that I felt fairly well, and able to eat some real food. Still very tired and weak, and still feel slightly out of breath. Temperature read 97.9.

Day 12. Woke up feeling good and temperature was my normal  The feeling of being out of breath has definitely lessened.

My takeaways: I got through this at home. \*Anxiety made this worse than the reality for me.\* Yes, it was bad, but not as bad as I previously believed it would be. With all the scary news we don’t hear about the older people (and most other people) that do recover.  I KNOW that the fear and anxiety was debilitating.

This virus can present in many ways. I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I’m convinced I got it at the dentist office, but this can’t be substantiated one way or the other. I guess even with the best of precautions, there are a lot of aerosols in the air from drilling and teeth cleaning in a dentist office.  In retrospect, I should have worn my mask while walking to and from the dentist chair.

I expect to feel tired/weak for a while but will venture outside today for a short walk.  I am now optimistic for a good recovery.  Time will tell if I have any future flare-ups.

We will continue to practice sensible protection measures at home.  I like to think my supplements helped, but I’ll never know for sure. Husband continues to show no symptoms and ran 10 miles this morning. Per doctor’s orders, he will continue quarantine for two more weeks.

One more EDIT: Day 15, start of Week 3.  I'm starting to feel human again, although still weak and tired.  I had a weird fever spike the night before last, and then it dropped and hasn't risen out of my normal range since.  Today I want to eat food!   Husband has remained healthy throughout.

EDIT; Day 17.  I'm seeing some ups and downs.  Temperature is still normal, but I ended up sleeping most of yesterday and just feeling fatigued.  Today, feeling better, but just weak and worn out.  Doctor said that having good days and then a bad day is not abnormal., and has no concerns since my breathing is fine and temp normal.

Day 19.  Temperature has remained normal, but the anxiety...  I still have ups and downs.  I have periods that last a few hours where I feel light-headed and ill again.  Then the anxiety rears its ugly head and I think I'm having some sort of Covid flare-up, and the rational part of my brain tells me it's anxiety, not illness.  Convincing oneself that it's anxiety does not always work, sadly.  My temperature will rise a little bit, but I \*think\* that may be due to anxiety.  I know that anxiety episodes can raise my temperature.  A few hours later, I feel better again.  Doctor is not too concerned about this as long as temperature stays in normal range and I can breathe.  From what I'm reading, it seems there is no universal way that people recover given the information available.  


Overall I am MUCH better than I was during the first 2 weeks.  I'm finally able to eat small amounts of food everyday.   I've lost about 10 lbs., which is good, but NOT a good way to do it.  At the worst I had zero appetite and couldn't eat anything, but continued to take a multivitamin and extra Vit D and zinc, as well as drinking a lot of water.",2020-06-26 15:22:14

My birthday's in a month and a half and I hate it even when there isn't a pandemic, and with the current situation, even thinking about it makes me desperate to slit my wrists. So, I did the math and came up with a logical plan: if cases were still spiking with no federal mitigation measures and borders were still closed by my birthday, I would kill myself the night before. After all, if these measures got better (unlikely), there would be hope for a future other than death, but if they didn't, life would be too miserable to be worth living anyway. After months and months of uncertainty and helplessness literally making me sick, I felt lighter. Clearer. Happy. I had a \*plan\*. I had a plan with benchmarks and numbers to follow. I had a goal and something to prepare for. There was finally an end in sight. And now that I knew that  my life would probably still be ending, I could actually enjoy the few small bits of happiness I had left.

Then, I realized - we live in an era of mass death. My self-inflicted death would literally make things worse, nationally. It would overload the morgues and healthcare systems. I'd put essential workers at unnecessary risk handling my body. My friends who are mentally strong enough to survive this wouldn't be able to throw me a funeral. I can't do it. It would actively hurt the world. And now I'm spiraling down in a black hole of despair that feels so endless I wish I would get a fluke fatal heart attack that would make the decision for me. It's my moral duty to stay alive, but I wish more than anything that I wasn't. I'm trapped in a failed state that I won't be able to legally flee, helplessly watching the bodies pile up, knowing the world as I know it is ending and being told that I should stay positive for a vaccine that won't be mass distributed for years if we get one at all, but maybe I should be cheerful because capitalism will end on the backs of mass death! after everything I loved and brought me joy has ended with it, of course. I'm staring down the barrel of a bleak, depressing, hopeless next five years or more of life, followed by a hypothetical glorious revolution that might not happen, and will make my job, my hobbies, and everything that brings me joy irrelevant. I wish I could die now. I wish I had died before this. And now I'm denied even the basic relief of having a guaranteed end to this misery.

UPDATE: Guys, I appreciate the kind words and those who have reached out to me, but I cannot just ""get help"". And I've tried. None of the psychiatrists I've called are accepting new patients, and every therapist in the world has a backlog at critical mass right now. With the upcoming economic depression/collapse when the eviction moratorium ends and extra unemployment runs out at the end of July, I'd feel irresponsible spending that much on mental health anyway. Plus, there's no therapist or pill that can change the fact that I'm trapped in a failed state with sealed borders and no prospects during an election year and a global pandemic. I'm staying alive for my cat right now and am at no immediate risk. I'm miserable all the time, but feeling miserable won't kill you.",2020-06-26 22:50:36
276,I just feel exhausted!,9,hgcz0c,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hgcz0c/i_just_feel_exhausted/,4,"I have been working from home since mid-March - at first I thought I would prefer it, but I haven't enjoyed it as much as I thought I would. I've noticed that the longer the pandemic goes on, the more depressed and exhausted I feel. 

I feel like I've become addicted to checking social media, even though there's a lot of stuff on there that makes me unhappy - I don't want to miss out on anything important and it relieves boredom even if it makes me annoyed sometimes. I can sometimes spend several hours in the evening scrolling through social media, and then when the evening is over, I feel disappointed that I wasted my time instead of doing something productive (like an online course, or even something away from the internet completely). 

I have tried using apps which block social media for a couple of hours each evening, in the hope that I will then be able to get on with other things. However, it doesn't work - often I just get the urge to circumvent the block and carry on as usual. I no longer get the same level of instant enjoyment from doing things offline compared to scrolling through social media, such as reading a book/magazine or other offline hobbies. Yet, I think I would feel happier in the long-term if I did spend more time offline, even if I don't enjoy it so much to begin with. 

Ever since I've been working from home, I've picked up bad habits such as going to bed late, feeling tired during the day, then having to have a nap as soon as my work hours are finished. Because I've had a nap, I then don't feel tired at night and the cycle continues. My motivation levels are lower than they used to be, compared to working in the office. I also feel moody and tetchy during the day. I eat unhealthily during the day to give myself something to look forward to, and to stop myself from feeling sleepy, and I don't exercise in the evenings any more as I just don't have the energy for it. It sounds silly, but I don't wash my hair as often as I used to, because I think ""what's the point if no one will see it?""

At the start, I was optimistic we would come out of this pandemic as a kinder society - for example, people were setting up mutual aid groups to volunteer to pick up food and medication for others in their communities, people were showing more appreciation towards essential workers and so on. There was a sense of togetherness and solidarity, even though we were all practising social distancing. 

However, in the last few weeks, it feels like everything has gone back to even worse than it was before - terrorism and racism have returned with a vengence, and people are leaving behind litter at beauty spots as they gradually ease out of lockdown. Some people are behaving irresponsibly in large crowds, for example holding illegal parties (officially gatherings of more than 6 people are still banned, unless you're from the same household), visiting extremely busy beaches, not social distancing, etc, and I'm concerned all this could result in a second peak.

I haven't had a proper break from work since the Christmas holidays (apart from public holidays and a day off for my birthday). I have a 2-week holiday coming up in the second week of July and it can't come soon enough. I won't be going to my planned destination, but it will be good to have a break from work and be able to go out for days locally (eg quiet walks in the countryside).",2020-06-26 22:23:15

279,Anxiety through the roof,3,hghpiw,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hghpiw/anxiety_through_the_roof/,1,"Hey everyone! 

**TLDR; No bullshit, been on literal house arrest since March 15th. Going crazy but parents make me stay at home.** 

I just want to preface this by saying that while my parents mean well, they become critical if I contradict them. I've never actually been close with my parents ever, in the traditional sense. What came was a relationship where I can't stand them for prolonged times. 

Since March 15th, I've been quarantined. I was previously away at college but came back in light of current events to take care of my parents (both over 60) because they're older and also since they don't speak English very well. I had originally thought that I would be fine staying home and helping around, provided I would have some sort of freedom. 

But, since March 15th, I've literally had absolutely no human contact besides my parents and brother. My parents placed EXTREME emphasis on grades, so I constantly hear my parents yelling at my brother to do his homework (he's almost 18). When groceries come, everything is sprayed down, even the eggs, each individually. Packages when come are left out front for a minimum for 2-3 days. Gardners come on Mondays and Thursdays, and pool guy comes on Wednesdays, so I can't even walk around the yard on those days. If I remain quiet for too long, my parents tear apart the house looking for me. 

I'm a big driving fanatic (vroom vroom) so one of the only ways that I can actually find solace is through driving. However, I've explained to my parents multiple times my exact plan (even offered to vlog my whole drive), but my parents are adamant about letting me stay at home. It's gotten to the point where I wake up and sometimes wish I hadn't, or want to go back to sleep because then I won't feel anything. 

I've tried to explain my feelings with my parents and to maybe work some common ground with them.  However, every time I mention my anxiety, they just tell me that everything is a ""me"" problem, and that I can't change life, but I can change myself. My main concern is that my 18 y/o brother and his inability to contribute. He literally doesn't check his emails and I had to do all his homework (and I mean ALL) for him when I came back from college. I've tried to explain to my parents that me being home isn't beneficial to my own mental health, as I genuinely can't remember the last time I was happy that didn't involve weed or munchies. My parents made it every clear to me that if I leave, I can (quite literally) kiss goodbye to seeing my family ever again (presumably guilt tripping). My dad even told me that I am not allowed to leave because me leaving will cause him to be anxious. 

So now I'm stuck in this corner. If I leave, I carry a lot of anxiety from what my parents have said, along with the possibility of not seeing my family. But if I stay, I genuinely want to sleep and never wake up again. 

Is anyone else in this particular situation? I'm too nice to tell my parents that this household is the cause of my anxiety. 

Is there a clear choice you guys would make in this situation?",2020-06-27 02:36:17

I live in a small 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment with a roommate who doesn’t take literally any precautions against getting COVID. She goes to her friends’ houses multiple times a week, she goes to bars and restaurants, I even heard her today on the phone talking about how she’s going back to the gym. I live in a big city, its not the middle of nowhere where there are no cases. She doesn’t even wash her hands when she comes home. 

I have talked to her a lot about how scared I am and about how we need to take precautions to be safe and she literally doesn’t care. She asked last week, for like the 5th time, if she could bring her friends over and when I said no she told me my fears were bullshit and that she was “sick of always driving to them”. 

We share a bathroom. I have preexisting things that make me really scared of complications if I get COVID. How do I protect myself when she gets it? I have no where to go. I don’t have a parent’s house or a friend’s house to move into. What do I do",2020-06-26 19:52:39
281,"Testing nightmare, nurse had unsanitary practices and now I’m afraid I’ve definitely been exposed to COVID if I haven’t already been, please help ease my fears",15,hg8ehm,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hg8ehm/testing_nightmare_nurse_had_unsanitary_practices/,3,"This is long, so there will be a TLDR at the end for tired eyes.

I’ve been freaking out for the last week now, after a woman refused to wear a mask or to social distance at the airport on Thursday, and coughed on me in the bathroom. I felt her spit cloud hit me and absolutely freaked out. I was of course masked up, but it makes only a marginal difference, since she was sick and she wasn’t masked, nor would she stand far away while coughing. She didn’t even cover her mouth. 

I started feeling mildly feverish on Monday, with a temp of about 99.8 Fahrenheit, but I also had raging food poisoning over the weekend, so there’s that. It was almost certainly food poisoning, because my husband ate the same thing I had, the food tasted off, and we both were sick within an hour of eating. He just has an iron stomach and I have a laundry list of chronic GI diseases, so it took him maybe three hours to get over it, and it took me four days. I know it’s a possibility, but I also know that the food we ate was unequivocally bad, and prior to traveling we had been social distancing and staying home like pros. I’ve barely left my home since March, mask always + eyewear, wash and sanitize my hands before and after I touch any surface that exists, and up the day we flew, seldom came into contact with people who hadn’t been doing the same. 

I am high risk, and my mother is extremely high risk, as she is a diabetic and also has an autoimmune disease. My husband and I live in a converted space above my parent’s house, so while we have no reason to leave beyond laundry and dishes, and can definitely  work ways to stay away from them, we do share an entryway and a ventilation system. So, I decided to self quarantine, play it safe and get a test. I got a referral from my doctor, but the testing location affiliated with my hospital system was not within driving distance, so I was referred to an unaffiliated clinic down the street.

This clinic is known to us as not being the best, as it is the same location where a nurse administering a routine injection, injected it into the wrong muscle and caused me a very painful nerve injury. But, beggars can’t be choosers. This was the only place remotely close that would test me the next day with no upfront cost, regardless of insurance and whether or not I had a high fever. 

Getting tested through this place was hellish. They used equipment on me that hadn’t been properly sterilized. The doctor rubbed a saniwipe on the handle of the ear-looking glass-thingy, but didn’t change the disposable tip that is inserted into the ear. The oxygen reader thing they put on my finger was probably not sterilized between uses (usually has a clear plastic barrier between your skin and the device, this didn’t and looked physically grimy). Didn’t sterilize the stethoscope. Forgot some of his PPE and put it on mid-consultation. (It wasn’t just a swab, they had the doctor come out and ask questions and take some vitals). Absolutely terrified me, because I know that if I don’t have COVID, someone had that equipment used on them and stuck onto and into all of the same orifices and appendages that most certainly *does.*

Yesterday, I got a call from the clinic and there is a real human being on the other side, not a prerecorded message. My heart is absolutely pounding because I think they’re about to tell me that my results are positive, because they said they wouldn’t call me directly if it was negative (I’d just get a canned message). The nurse on the other end says that I need to be reswabbed, and that the lab probably lost my test. 

So, I came back to the clinic and waited in my car, and I saw the nurse through the window coming to swab me. I see her wearing gloves and, with those gloves, sets her hand down on the counter at the check in, and kind of drums on it and leans against the wall while she chats with the receptionist, then uses those same gloved hands to open the door. No glove change. Now I’m getting nervous, but I realize that swab is really long and her hands will probably not come into contact with my body in anyway. *Wrong.* As soon as open my mouth and the swab goes in, I feel her gloved hand touch the inside of my mouth. It hits my teeth and the top of the inside of my lip and even onto the top of my tongue, to be exact. I tasted nitrile. 

I am so done with this. I have barely slept for the last week. I keep replaying micro-decisions that may have led to a possible exposure. I feel dumb for not saying something or doing more. I have trouble falling asleep and wake up in the middle of the night and think about my mortality, because COVID19 is the epitome of all of my fears, and happened to surface right after I *finally* recovered from a life altering illness that had me so sick that it, once I was better, had me vowing to never see a doctor again if I wasn’t knocking on death’s door. I was hospitalized several times, the sickest I’ve ever been in my entire life. I was so sick that the medications I was given to manage my condition made me even sicker, and ultimately ended with me developing a life-threatening medication reaction due to a doctor’s prescribing mistake. Since that moment, I have been high-key afraid of hospitals, needles, new meds, and any doctor that isn’t the family doctor who has been seeing me since 2015. 

I never, every want to feel close to that sick again. Until maybe, two months ago, I could barely talk about my illness, which my friends and family found odd, because that was a huge chunk of my life last year and now I never talk about it, even to explain that I’m doing better than I was. Family asks how I’m doing and I just change the subject, because I don’t even want to acknowledge how sick I was. Part of me is always scares that, it I talk about it directly, it could come back. It is *the time which shall not be named.* It terrifies me to think that there’s even a remote possibility that I could get that sick again. 

I didn’t just spend almost two years fighting for my life and some semblance of normalcy so that I could be bulldozed by a virus. 

Does it seem likely that if I don’t have COVID, I could have gotten it from the shoddy practices at the testing site? 

(Side note, guys, absolutely do not fly right now, even if the airline tells you they are practicing social distancing. The best they are doing is 1. boarding in groups of 10, still too large and not giving enough space between groups to make a difference, 2. Leaving middle sears empty, which is like, maybe 18 inches of “extra,” space, and 3. Telling everyone they have to mask while on the plane except when eating, which the flight attendants mostly can’t enforce after takeoff for reasons of their own safety whilst trapped in a tin can with belligerent people, 30,000 ft from the ground. 

I would say that the majority of people flying either wore their mask incorrectly - noses out or as a chinstrap - or not at all. Literally no one cares about standing on the little dots or whatever. I could be wearing a shirt that says “six feet please,” wearing a bunch of pool noodles longways, in a wheelchair and carrying an oxygen tank and still, no one would social distance from me. The TSA isn’t changing their gloves either, and they are making you unmask at various parts of the security checkpoint). 

TLDR: Got tested to be safe after traveling and being coughed on directly, since I am high risk and my mom is very high risk. The testing site I went to had unsanitary practices. The tech/nurse touched several surfaces in the waiting room with her gloves on, then shoved those same gloves into my mouth and touched the inside. Sickness terrorizes my thoughts. Is my exposure risk high from this encounter in particular?

I live with my partner, she lives alone, and it's been nearly 2 years since we last saw each other. My significant other has to drive to a place just handful of hours away from my hometown, and I've been seriously contemplating tagging along in order to go be with my mom. If I go, the stay would have to be for about a month, and I'd have to stay at her place. 

I wouldn't be flying and haven't told anybody else about the potential visit because I don't plan on going out or seeing anybody else. I'm not looking for a vacation, I just want to be with my mom. My biggest concern, though, is her being high risk.

We've been taking things seriously and working hard to do things right during all of this. I wear a mask when going out, try to only go out when necessary and when it's less likely to be busy, and I do my best to keep my distance from others. I've been in self-isolation since being furloughed a couple weeks ago (aside from a necessary grocery run). My partner is still working. 

I'm feeling incredibly torn up about it all. I don't know when I'll have a chance to take this kind of time with her again. She struggles with depression and PTSD and I worry about her. I'm struggling a bit myself right now and it would feel good to see her. But the idea of going also feels incredibly irresponsible.

I work for a call center I.T. company. We do IT remotely for over 500 companies in the State of NJ where the COVID-19 numbers have been one of the highest in the country.

During Phase 1 (from March through May), we had a perfect work from home infrastructure and our technicians thrived. Our ticket counts were the lowest they have been in years, all while working from home. All our clients were paying us and our owner still qualified for government assistance for over $5 Million that I'm pretty sure he doesn't have to repay. We are NOT hurting financially at all.

In New Jersey, Phases 1, 2 & 3 all require that office workers work from home if at all possible. While still in phase 1, my employer started to mandate that all employees come in the office (even though we had a perfect work from home infrastructure in place).

This wasn't quite what bothered me though. What really bothered me was the fact that when you got to the office, there wasn't any safety precautions put into effect. All the employees were walking around without masks. Anyone that didn't have a mask was called out by our bosses and made to look childish and incompetent. They attacked us mentally and made snarky remarks in front of all our co-workers. They essentially demean you until you give up and remove your mask. They also called large meetings into a small conference room where employees were forced to stand shoulder to shoulder without any PPE.

I've worked here for over 5 years and I'm yet to experience this type of toxic work environment up until this point. It almost feels as if they are trying to push their political agenda on you.

I'm not sure what to do. They are still in fact paying the bills, but at what cost? Should I just shut-up and color, or should I stand my ground? If I choose the latter, what are my options?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm quite lost right now and mentally exhausted over this matter. Also, my owner does NOT believe in a HR department for a company with over 100 employees, so we do not have one.",2020-06-25 18:03:12

Disclaimer: This is based purely off my experience and I'm not a doctor or medical professional. I used to be an EMT but my license has since expired. Didn't make enough money🤷🏼‍♂️

I live in Fort Lauderdale Florida which is in Broward County. One of the main counties affected by this virus in Florida. As I stated above I developed a weird illness in early February that about half my office devoloped and showed symptoms for. At the time I remember most people in the country and other parts of the world sounding and being sick. Playing call of duty online at night has you conversing with people in different states and even different countries. Many of which sounded sick at the point in time. I remember saying back then something weird is going on. Anyways I got over it like many did after about two weeks. 

About two months later we were having some construction done where I live and kicked up a lot of dust. Disturbing things that haven't been disturbed in years. During that time my throat became noticably irritated and I didn't feel well. I lost my sense of smell and taste which apparently means this virus may affect our central nervous system which would make sense because I had hypersensitivity to light and sounds for a little bit. I also woke up a few nights feeling out of breath and wide awake. Also remember having headaches and periods in time where I felt confused and very much out of it. My girlfriend also shared with my that she was experiencing some of the same symptoms. I attributed it to the dust because that just made sense and it was the only thing that had changed. Ended up staying at my girlfriends parents house with her for a few days. Symptoms pretty much persisted but I figured the dust or VOCs (volatile organic compounds) were still in my system. After about two weeks my noticable symptoms disappeared. We both agreed that we would rest and avoid unnecessary trips just to be on the safe side and do our best not to spread anything in case we had it. Shortly after the noticable symptoms disappeared but I woke up at 4am one night with one sided weakness in my body and a blood pressure of 182/110. It worked itself out after about a half hour. I later learned people were having strokes and heart attacks in the later stages of Covid recovery. Looking back I should have gone to the ER. About three weeks after that I felt completely back to normal, exercising again and eating regularly. 


Now about two months after that experience began lands me to about 14 days prior to present day. The construction guys came and finished the project. Kicking up more dust and kicking up my symptoms again. Same symptoms appeared some being less noticable or severe and some being the same. Loss my sense of taste and smell briefly again, headaches came back and so did elevated blood pressure and brief moments of shortness of breath as well as hypersensitivity to lights and sounds. Feeling the fight or flight symptoms coming often and strong especially at night when humans are naturally more anxious anyways. Now at this point in time I researched Covid quite a bit more and as time passed more theories and study's were being shared. This time I was tested for Covid and I'm still waiting on results. 

I have a couple theories of what may be happening. I've read about people testing positive a few times even after testing negative so maybe for some people the virus lays dormant for a short span while our body is still producing antibodies to fight it. I have also been reading some studies are showing antibodies are only being produced by the body for about two months which would also make sense for me. Now my theory is this, if this virus stays dormant while our body is still producing antibodies to fight it but not fully killing it what if when those antibodies start to wear off and maybe a stressful event for our immune system can kick start the Covid again? It would make sense for my situation. 

I know my circumstances are probably pretty unique but I wanted to throw this out there to spark some convo and thoughts. Please feel free to share thoughts or experiences",2020-06-25 20:16:13

I’m sorry if this is not the right place to ask, but I’m not sure where to go. I could really use some support/advice.

I am 30F and live in the US (Massachusetts - not Boston). I have no real pre-existing “conditions”. But I have had cheilitis (medically chapped lips) and intermittent GI issues (lack of appetite, regular stomach upset, ssometimes what feels like chest congestion but is not and is probably just indigestion) since about October of last year. I also developed sciatic pain in my leg in May, and I have an anxiety disorder and depression. 

Anyway, I live with my parents who are in their 60s, and my father [66M] will be visiting my grandfather [95M] in his assisted living home this weekend. My grandfather has many preexisting conditions.

I have been experiencing on/off stomach pain (likely related to my anxiety disorder and ongoing GI issues) for a couple of weeks and the “chest congestion” (that I’ve experienced before and is not actual congestion but more likely indigestion), but I have not had nausea, diarrhea, or any other symptoms of covid. My parents [60s] have no symptoms. 

My parents only go to stores as needed (with masks) and for walks (without masks). I have not gone to the stores at all, but I go for walks (without mask), to work occasionally (no one is there / wear mask), and to a few doc appts (including PT which is very hands-on and involves laying on a bed/using pillows other people have used / obvi with mask).


I am wondering if I should get a covid test before my father visits my grandfather?

I am struggling with this because we don’t really have symptoms of covid (as far as I know).  I don’t want to take tests from anyone else (and don’t even know if they’d LET me get tested), and I don’t want to get tested if it’s not necessary and would actually put me at greater risk by being at a testing location. But if one of us has it (more likely me because of PT) and unknowingly brings it to my grandfather’s place, the consequences could be huge.",2020-06-25 20:17:27

I'm general my state is doing well, not great but still well with COVID.

As of today there are some indoor entertainment that have opened not following government guidelines, however the government today in Maine deemed Escape Rooms eligible to reopen on July 1st.

I have the privilege of not having to rush to open, which is a weird privilege. However I do feel that I have a responsibility to open my business at some point soon for my staff with it looking like unemployment will be ending at the end of July.

Does anyone know of a business group to talk about these types of things?

What do you think about it as a person that might work for a small business?

In general I want to hear from as many people as possible about what they think.

tl;dr: Business owner doesn't have to rush to open, but feels that that might be irresponsible to their staff and wants to know what people think",2020-06-25 07:32:18

I am a current college student who has come home due to the current COVID-19 situation and have been home since March. We all (parents and sister) have been quarantining at home since March only going out for groceries and since our state is on Phase 2 re-opening we have gone out to a sporting goods store. Other than that, we really don’t go out much and my parents work from home. Anytime they go to the grocery store usually another person goes with them. 

Since yesterday my dad has been slowly developing a cough. He’s the only person in our house with a cough but him and I do both have allergies so we tend to clear our throat a lot. Today he has been coughing quite a bit, he says he has a little runny nose, doesn’t feel too energetic and I checked his temperature that said 96.2 (not sure if it was working properly). However, I have severe panic disorder and OCD especially when it comes to my family so now that he has been coughing I have been sent off the deep end. He had a heart attack maybe 10 years ago, is on medications and has been a lot better since by cleaning up his lifestyle tremendously. Could that impact his severity of COVID if he does get it? Nowadays, I find myself just freaking out about every little thing and don’t know what would happen if he ended up testing positive.. 

If anyone has any advice on how they calm their thoughts and try to think positively during this time I would greatly appreciate it.",2020-06-24 23:01:35
301,Roommate not quarantining,6,hf3fwj,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hf3fwj/roommate_not_quarantining/,3,"I feel like I might be crazy. So our roommate has been staying with her mom in the PNW since the end of April. The three of us in the apartment had a long discussion about how she could do this and try to mitigate any risks, and we discussed the possibility of her quarantining in an AirBNB or something for a week or so after coming back. With that, we all felt better about her trip, and off she went.

A few weeks ago, she mentioned her plans to see friends in our city on July 10. I asked if she had looked at flights yet and she hadn’t. A couple nights ago, she told me she would be flying back on the 5th. I figured that was fine since she could get off the plane, quarantine, and then see her friends after 5 days of no symptoms. 

Now we find out that she’s not planning on quarantining herself at all except for chilling in the apartment after she lands. She said that if we want to stay at our parents’ places, we can go do that. Her thought process is that if she’s planning to see friends anyway, and everything is opening up again, then what good is there in quarantining? 

To me, the good in quarantining is preventing spread of the virus to the other roommates and her friends. How does she not see that? The two of us here have stayed home for 3 months and are willing and able to continue to do so. Is there a middle ground here? I thought quarantining after the trip WAS the middle ground.",2020-06-24 19:52:39

The company I work for is making everyone wear masks, do temperature checks upon arriving, cleaning and sanitizing bathrooms and break rooms often, etc. 

The company provided people with masks who don't have one to use; others bring masks from home. Most people wear the company-provided mask, which is a thin, single-layer, loose-fitting mask (basically no protection whatsoever). Many wear them improperly. 

The thermometers aren't accurate at all. I walk 5 blocks to work from my house, and the forehead theromometers (I used three because I didn't think they were accurate) read 94 degrees. If someone did come in with a fever, the thermometers wouldn't detect it. Hopefully they'd feel physically sick enough to not bother coming in, or to at least go to the nurse. 

Social distancing is a complete fail. I'm on an assembly line and pretty much nobody even tries to give each other space. I can reach out and touch one or two people (or more) most places I stand. 

Even though break rooms and bathrooms get cleaned and sanitized, the main floors where we work do not. Dirty surfaces, tools, etc. 

Our facility is ventilated-- we have two large vents that circulate air from outside, plus there's smaller fans everywhere. So basically any potential virus is blown everywhere! 

Of the 1400+ workers at my factory, 4 or 5 have gotten Covid since the beginning of the year. So far, nobody in my department has gotten sick. But if someone does, a lot of others probably will too. 

Both my parents, whom I still live with, have health issues, and are in their 50s. My dad and my brother also work in the same factory, but in different departments where social distancing is much easier than in my department. I'd be most likely to get infected and bring home the virus to my family. Oh, and my house makes it impossible to self-isolate, so if I get sick, we all get sick. 

I've had a lot of anxiety surrounding Covid before starting work, and now that I've started, I'm feeling hopeless. I need the money, and few places in town pay as well. I currently don't have a car and can't drive myself to a different job so that others in my family can drive to their jobs, so having the factory walking distance from my house is convenient (though I still plan to save up for one). I feel like I'm in a really bad situation and I can't really do much of anything to improve it. 

I really want to avoid this awful virus, mostly for my parents' sakes. I'm more likely to be mostly okay if I get it (though I'm still scared of it) than they are. There are times when I'm by myself that I just can't handle my fears and I just cry. I'm trapped and there's no way out other than being broke and living off my parents, which I don't want to do.",2020-06-24 03:25:27

So my best friend (F21) and I (F22) have been talking about her birthday on July 4th. We planned on only being at her house and she would invite me and my boyfriend a couple of her friends over to be by the pool and drink. She has been very excited to see me and so have I. But, I've also been worried about it since she and the people she sees aren't being 100% safe, she's gone to bars multiple nights and I also saw she went to the club, I was afraid to tell her how I felt. I also haven't been going to any public places like bars and restaurants and seeing friends only my family and my boyfriend and his family. 2 days ago I explained how I felt to her and the worry I had about her birthday and asked if she could stay safe till her birthday so I didn't need to feel so worried when I went to see her. Her response seemed like it kinda annoyed her and it was kinda insensitive since I was her main plan for her birthday. She told me to let her know if I was going or not in order to make other plans. It made me feel bad that she reacted to how she did. And I'm the type of person that doesn't like to have issues with anyone or have anyone mad at me. 

Today my boyfriend called me and told me that his sister tested positive for COVID and that his mom also seemed sick. I saw him yesterday and we kissed, I also went to his house and was around his sister and his family the day before. He obviously can't go to my friend's birthday party since he was highly exposed. I also don't feel safe going especially since I was also semi-exposed. In my opinion, I feel I shouldn't go. But I am worried to tell her my boyfriend and I aren't going since she will be disappointed.",2020-06-24 06:03:13

I attend school out of state, so my closest friends are about 2 hours away. I don’t really want to do a Zoom call, because I feel like that would just make me even more bummed out. FaceTime and Zoom were nice at the beginning of all of this, but it’s just nowhere near the same as seeing someone face to face. My area has a relatively low rate of positive tests right now, so it seems like outdoor gatherings are low risk at the moment. But I don’t think it’s really fair of me to ask my friends to drive 2+ hours to come sit 10 feet apart in my driveway. I’m wondering if I should just forget about my birthday this year and celebrate it later on in the year when things are more stable. Then again, we don’t know when that will be so I very well could be celebrating my 22nd birthday by then.

I never really wanted a big party or anything. So I don’t know why I’m so bummed out about not getting anything now. I guess it just feels like a reminder of yet another thing I’m going to miss out on because of this pandemic. 

I also feel guilty for feeling sad about it. In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty lucky. There are people dying and losing their loved ones. Their are people losing their livelihoods and businesses. There are people who are missing their proms and graduations. But I’m sitting here sad about my birthday.",2020-06-24 04:53:49

Our neighbors are quite young and very social, which is fine by us. We see them on the porch and chat while being able to keep our distance and we are on good terms with them.
What worries me is that they have frequent parties (tonight is one girl's 19th bday party). Although we distance adequately and they respect us for it, they throw caution to the wind and have 10+ people over often.
So they smoke a lot of weed. We have zero issues with that but we have noticed that the weed smoke seems more potent in our place than even sitting on the porch. 
My husband investigated in the basement and found no evidence that our vents are wrongly installed but says it's still a possibility (for clarification, the 3 units all have separate heating/AC units but it is an old property, built in the 40s).  Neither of us want to get our neighbors in trouble as they are generally kind and respectful  and , well, its just pot, so we are hesitant to call our property manager.
I may be in the wrong sub for this question but would love it if someone could pont me in the right direction so we can find out if somehow our vents are crossed bc if someone next door has the virus, it's very possible that we could get in, in the event that there is truly a crossover with the air ducts and the aerosolized particles.  We live in a high risk ares and my husband has severe asthma so I'm pretty worried. 
Our state/urban region has exponential growth and is predicted to possibly be one of the next epicenters.  He is handy and can fix a lot and we are hoping not to get property maintenance involved, if possible.

But, I wore my mask when the waiter was out, and if I wasnt I didn't say anything to her. I didnt wear it in the car, cause there was no point. I didnt wash anything down with a wipe when we got our ice-cream. But I did put on hand sanitizer, several times and wore a mask when I was in the restaurant or when I first walked in rather.  When I got back to my sisters, I washed my hands. 

Other than that, I havent gone to much places. I went inside a restaurant Saturday where my sister's friends graduation party was but I wasn't in there long and I didnt touch anything and I was not really in close distance with many people, I did put on a mask when I realized I was in an indoor  restaurant.

I live with my mom, and she is constantly talking about my virus. She'll be like ""did you know there was 4,000 cases today?"". or she will talk about how she doesn't feel safe going anywhere, so she stays home, except for the few times we have left the house to go to work which we started up doing again or various things. Now this has been a pattern for 3 months, since it started popping up in my state, and even more so now since cases are spiking here. She will complain about people not wearing masks, or that ""people arent taking it seriously, life is not going back to normal"". blah blah blah. 

Now I have been okay with staying home more until recently, when I realized that my mental health was taking a decline because I was not getting out of the house. She on the other hand, has no problem staying home or isnt at least going insane. Since I've gone to my sisters, I've done more in the last week than I've done in the last 3 months. I wear a mask when I go out, and I put on hand sanitizer and I make sure I dont touch my face when I leave a place, or in general. 

I know she almost died of scarlet fever when she was 6, and I've tried to be really good, and if I could actually get my car fixed, I could take drives by myself at least, but that hasnt happened due to covid.

I’ve been living on my own (with my gf) for 3+ years now so having to move back home out of nowhere really sucks.

They’re really guilt tripping me about staying there though. Both of them have to go to work too so everyday they’re exposed. Idk if I’d feel safe. 

My girlfriends grandma is also in GA but a very rural area so I’d be able to spend a lot of time outside and be with my gf.

Then I had a pilonidal cyst flare up with a huge infection that had to be incised and went to the doctors yesterday - after hours because he is my fathers friend, no one but the doctor and nurses, all wearing masks, hospital empty (not the hospital where they take COVID patients, you basically need a negative test to be taken in unless an emergency here).

Today had to go have my wound packed again and did so at my dads office (another part of our hospital but not where they take in COVID patients). My dad who is a surgeon packed my wound, everyone had masks on and the only time I saw people was walking out as they took in an emergency case which was an injured child and his parents. I walked past them quickly but couldn't see if they had masks though my dad didn't seem concerned even though he tended to the child after I left.

And finally since I was down my mom basically made me go into this IT shop to ask for a computer since she was planning to gift me one for my birthday and for enrolling an animation university in the fall. I didn't want to go but she was making a scene so with societal pressure I went in, we were there for 5 min, no one else in the huge store but the staff, most had masks and one guy had it under his nose but we had 6 ft distance. 

I am home and feel kinda bad for all these interactions. My city's cases were on the rise, 100+ a day. We have like 1700 active cases on 550.000 people. Everything is open and people go out to cafes and restaurants. My friends wanted to go out with me for my birthday and I rejected the offer. I only go out on long drives with my car and to soak up some sun in abandoned fields. I am just so scared and I can't imagine ever relaxing as long as this virus is around and it's so depressing because it will be around. I can't ever just say ""fuck it"" and go live. And I know there is no 0% risk but I am scared and feel guilty for all of the above. I am sorry, this hit me harder than I ever imagined and these three months I went to places in my mind I didn't know existed. I just want to be able to relax.",2020-06-23 05:02:58
318,feeling selfish and guilty...,8,he7hn0,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/he7hn0/feeling_selfish_and_guilty/,6,"really just need somewhere to get this off my chest and this seems to be the best place. i'm 20 years old and live with my parents (both 55), sister (18), and grandma (85+ i think) in new york state where cases are falling every day and we seem to be doing pretty good. my grandma moved in with my family at the beginning of september, so she's a pretty new addition. no one in my household has left the house AT ALL since march 13th because of my grandma's age and the fact that she's prediabetic. 

at the beginning of all of this, i had no problem staying home. it was nice being around family and i have no problem just relaxing in pajamas all day. however, around the start of may, the social isolation started to really get to me. things where i live started to open up and the stay at home order lifted and all of my friends started hanging out again. i was definitely experiencing A LOT of fomo, but this is a pandemic and i live with someone extremely high risk so i pushed through. my parents made it clear from the beginning that no one would be leaving for any nonessential reason until schools opened back up and my sister and i went back to college. 

now it's the end of june and i'm finding it harder and harder to push through. it sounds so awful, but i started to resent my grandma's presence because i know that if she wasn't living here i would have way more freedom. last weekend was my best friends birthday and i had asked if i could hang out with her and a small group. my parents agreed, but i knew that appropriate social distancing measures would not be taken so i backed out. my dad felt really bad and said that he would try to come up with a plan so that my sister and i would have more freedom since he knows that it's been over 100 days since i've even seen someone that i wasn't related to. 

him and my mom eventually decided that after tomorrow my dad and grandma would move into our beach house in a different state and continue to isolate there while my mom, sister, and i would stay here and start to socialize with people (my older sister just had a baby and none of us have been able to meet her yet, so this was also factored into the decision). 

we are EXTREMELY fortunate to be able to do this, but i can't help but feel so incredibly guilty and selfish that this has to happen. i realize we are in a pandemic and this is not a situation to be taken lightly, so forcing members of my family to move out just so that i can maintain a bit of normalcy feels so wrong. i don't know where i'm going with this, but i just feel so horrible and i know it's wrong but i also have not been doing well at all in this situation and it feels like things will never go back to normal.",2020-06-23 07:56:25

My S/O and I are in our early-to-mid 20s. I currently live with my family and she lives with roommates but we’re planning to move in together in the future. I’ve been quarantined at her apartment since the beginning of April. I got laid off due to COVID and am still looking for a new job, but have enough money to get by for now. My S/O works online odd jobs for an associate. My S/O and her roommates are all from a country that was one of the first to be hit hard by COVID, while I’m from here in the US (However, my S/O and her roommates didn’t know each other prior to becoming roommates). I was initially planning to spend quarantine at my family’s house but my S/O wanted me to come see her. My S/O’s space is very small - she lives in a 3-bedroom apartment, with the living room converted into a 4th bedroom to fit in an extra person and save money, so we’re essentially almost always together in her small bedroom.

In mid-April, after two weeks at my S/O’s apartment, my mother tested positive for COVID and she self-isolated in her room at my house for two weeks after that. My mother was tested again in mid-May and tested positive, so she quarantined again. She was tested a 3rd time in the first week of June and tested negative. After some complications within the past several weeks, she feels a lot better now. Despite frequently being in close contact with my mom, four other relatives in my house (two brothers, my aunt and my elderly grandmother) all tested negative for COVID in mid-to-late May (my two brothers got tested at separate appointments, and my aunt and grandmother went together). I was honestly surprised as I thought the four of them would catch it for sure. Before my mom tested positive, they were not always the most responsible in taking precautions against COVID. What are the odds of four people receiving false negatives at three different appointments?

So now I’ve been at my S/O’s place for over two-and-a-half months. After following news in her home country, she’s extremely worried about the virus and critical of the U.S. health system. Thankfully, we haven’t had any major symptoms (though we both are a little chubby, and I had an unrelated disease in my lungs four years ago). She does not want us to get tested as she’s worried that medical facilities could be breeding grounds for the virus. She also doesn’t want me to go home as she’s worried that my mother could have gotten a false negative or still be infectious via her stool or something like that. She would prefer that my mother get two or three negative tests in a row before we consider going over, and I tried to hint at that to my mom, but she doesn’t really plan on getting tested again and her doctors haven’t recommended it or anything as far as I know. My mom is even going out to meet friends (with mask, gloves, etc.) Of course many of my clothes, legal documents and other stuff are still at my house. My relatives have hinted at times that they would like me to come back, and I do have some important matters to discuss which I feel might be better done in person.

My S/O’s roommates have very graciously tolerated my presence (“fortunately”, one of her roommates is in their home country and has not been able to return to the U.S. for several months due to travel restrictions) but things are a little tense/awkward at times with me and my S/O being together almost 24-hours a day. I do go outside at least a few times a week for walks and exercise and to run errands (with mask, gloves) and to give us some space, but sometimes she’s even worried about that. This entire time, she has only once gone outside the building without me, not even for exercise- if it’s a small errand, I almost always take care of it, if we need to get something outside the neighborhood from a supermarket from her culture or something, we’ll go together and is basically her moments where she enjoys being outside the apartment. One of S/O roommate’s works in a lab near a hospital and is outside almost every day, for what it’s worth (though my S/O insists she takes every precaution). It’s a bit overwhelming sometimes as I seem to have basically moved in and we don’t have much privacy.

For the past 3 and a half months, I’ve been doing everything from home. Ordering groceries, laundry, etc. Wiping everything down. Barely going outside. I’ve gone for drives and a few park walks but never around people. 

Now as more and more things open, and it seems like literally everyone I know has been doing there own thing for months, while I’ve stayed in this bubble, I thought it was time for me to get out there again and not feel so scared around people. 

Yesterday was my first real day of going out to a few stores. 

The irony is that everyone who I saw has probably been doing this for three months. Me? I felt like I was in a situation I never been in my life. Avoiding people. Dodging people. Becoming overwhelmed. 

Majority of people had masks in the stores, but a few didn’t cover their noses which annoyed and stressed me. That wasn’t even the biggest annoyance though. It was people didn’t give me my space. I was put into situations I wasn’t comfortable with because they didn’t social distance. Walking behind me close. When someone walked towards me, I was freaking out looking what way to move. 

Of course ima freak out now and hope I didn’t get sick walking past them but still..

I guess my question is, how do you get over the fear of being around other people now? They are use to it I’m sure, but not me. 

I can’t stay home forever. I will be going back to work soon. So I need to ease my way back

I just think it’s annoying that we don’t know really how it spreads. Will I catch it walking in an area someone else was walking? If they stand somewhere for a few mins and then I walk into that area to walk through, will I get it. 

Just stressful and overwhelming

That’s my vent

Thanks

EDIT UPDATE:

Just went to the grocery store for the first time. It was OK
Except, while waiting to check out 6' ahead of me, was a guy taking his mask on and off and talking. That annoyed me to no end. Then of course, when it was my turn, I had to walk in HIS AIR SPACE and wait 2 mins till it was called. I had a mask on but I really hope I don't catch it because of him

Secondly, the cashier directly behind me coughed. She had a mask on, and coughed into her elbow, so now thats 2 I need to worry about

I commend you all for being out there during these times. Now it's my turn. And I'm scared. 

My factory does require face masks and temp checks of every employee, thankfully. I've seen the face masks my job provides for people who dont have one, and they're so thin I can't imagine they do any good. I have some that are thicker that I plan to use.

I live in a small, rural town that has had very few cases. But I've seen more and more people going without masks and not social distancing, and it's just a matter of time before we are back where we started and worse. The apathy I see all around me scares me. How do people not understand how serious this is? Why are people so willfully ignorant? 

Both of my parents have underlying health issues, and are both essential workers. My house is small and self isolation would be impossible if one of us got sick. Even if my parents survived covid, they could be left disabled for months or even for good. I'm afraid the same could happen to me and affect my job and career paths, future relationships, the ability to have or raise children, etc. I feel like I'm pre-grieving what might happen later. 

I've been struggling with severe anxiety over covid for the past several months and it's affected almost every area of my life. I've booked a doctor's appointment this week to get it checked out and maybe go on meds. I was supposed to student teach this fall, and I think I'm going to postpone it because I'm scared I could get infected and not know and bring it home to my parents. But working on an assembly line probably wont be any better. I feel stuck with no way out. I want a therapist, but I can't afford one on my insurance. 

The anxiety right now makes me just want to not go in to work tomorrow and say screw it, its not worth it. I can handle not going places or seeing people regularly for awhile; it's the stress of the pandemic and fear of the unknown that I'm not sure I can handle much longer.",2020-06-22 06:17:19

I live with an individual who isn't that healthy, missing part of a lung, and I worry about protecting them. Which is why I wear a full face mask with an additional disposable N95 mask underneath and gloves when I am out.The mask in question is a leather one that covers my full face, and is well fitted along the edges, and transparent lenses for me to see. The holes near the mouth let in just enough air that is then filtered through the disposable mask underneath. I am a strong believer that every layer of protection counts.Sadly, the mall I live near has its entire security run by Loblaws, and the security manager says its their policy to not allow a mask that completely conceals a person's face (Despite the fact most other mask's already cover something like 80% of a persons face). So you can understand my frustration with them, even after offering them my ID.I want to know if there is an legal ruling that with the current COVID crisis, even if its on the down trend in Canada, (for now) that prevents them from preventing me from wearing my preferred level of protection.",2020-06-22 04:11:25

Then in mid May everything changed. I don’t feel like myself anymore most days. Sometimes I’ll be able to forget and just have fun and live in the moment. I’ll also have good days.

I’m struggling more and more to do that, I look ahead and I see pain, I see fear, I see hopelessness. I’ve already reached out to friends and family and they all encourage me to take the step and reach out to my doctors. But I don’t want pills. I would like to be able to just talk to a therapist. I don’t know if I can. Sometimes I feel like if I just hold on by myself a little longer it will all go away and I don’t need to reach out. Like I can dig myself out if I just try harder. 
I’m so confused. I miss me. I want help, but I’m afraid to ask for it.",2020-06-21 21:16:47

I had to pick up a grocery order today. I live upstairs in an urban apt building. The delivery lady couldn't find a parking spot so I helped put the groceries in my home cart. Maybe took a minute and we both had masks. Then I had to ride one floor on the elevator with my two unmasked neighbors. Then it was scrub/disinfect groceries, wash my hands five or six times, put my phone and keys and mask in the uv light sterilizer. Now I am obsessed that the rona germ jumped into my mask on that elevator.

But....when I was outside people were chatting, drinking, talking, no masks, totally relaxed. One bar is already open and busy. People were so happy.

I am so exhausted and depressed from living all alone and in constant fear just to get a few groceries I don't think I can take this much longer. I am about ready to say fuck it and just go live like everybody else. Before you say it, sure some of it is jealousy, but it is more. It feels like constant punishment. Punishment for a crime I haven't committed.

I booked a luxe hotel room to see my friend. I checked in and had a mask on. No one but the receptionist was there. Then my friend came over and she has been quarantined mostly, as well with some going to lunch on outside patios (but not meeting up with anyone). We stayed here in the hotel about 15 minutes but were more than 6ft apart and the room is HUGE and then we left. I rolled all the windows in my car down, wore a mask, and we were going pretty high speeds for the most part. 

We went to a private beach with no one really around, only about 6 people and all more than 30ft away. We took some pics but I held my breath for the one or two selfies and then immediately parted. 

I ordered takeaway once I got back to my room. Washed my hands before as well. My friend has lupus and her mom does too so they have had to be careful, so I am hoping I am now safe too.

I took all the precautions but I feel like I failed. I have been quarantined since February, even before it was called the right thing to do. I've been wearing a mask since then too. I have asthma as well but I just couldn't take not going out for 1 day. I needed one day. Just one. And now I feel so guilty. I avoided crowds. I just, now I feel like it is a waiting game of two weeks.

I live 7 hours away from them. We live in NYS, I live in a lower risk area and my family lives on Long Island, an area that has only recently started to calm down. My brother and sister in law had a baby 2 months ago and I hadn’t met her yet. They have been super careful and have not left the house, except my sister in law had to take the baby to the pediatrician 2 weeks ago for vaccinations. My sister in law’s mother has been coming over but she has also been very, very careful. Since they have been so careful, I decided to stay with them in their basement. 

I got there today. Like I said, they have been extremely careful. This is where I made a mistake. I have not worn a mask in their house and I have been hanging out with them in their living room. I’ve been keeping a distance of 6 feet from my sister in law, but not really with my brother, and I was not distant with my 3 year old nephew, their son. At about 10 pm, my sister in law developed a really bad headache. She said the headache is in her forehead, and she was feeling nauseous from it. She said she hasn’t ever felt a headache like that before. I am worried this could be Covid related and that I have now exposed myself, but it could also just be a migraine. I don’t think she has any other symptoms besides fatigue, but she has an infant so that could explain that. She did mention that she was feeling kind of dizzy/off for a bit before the headache.

She hasn’t been sleeping well because she has a 2 month old that only sleeps 2 hours at a time, as well as a 3 year old to keep up with. She worked out outside today for the first time in a while as well, and spent most of the day outside in the heat.

For me personally I flew southwest and they have all middle seats blocked out till September 30th, face masks at all times (you aren’t let on unless you have one), and they are boarding in groups of 10 to space it out. The airports themselves had almost all the shops closed. Just one store in each airport that had drinks snacks ect. There is social distancing markers everywhere.

After the two months my gf had to go back financially despite being at risk. I'm currently staying at my mother's house feeling like a needed a break and so she can lay the land over at the apartment. Since I've been gone the roommate has people over, going out and getting food delivered every day and just invited 8 people to go hang out at a river tomorrow. And her brother who is staying over the apartment for free and going to bars and seeing a girl. My girlfriend is really passive about it. She understands that COVID is a serious thing but isn't doing anything to try and stop or limit this behavior. It's our living space too. 



Now I've gone back to my retail job after 3 months and I just felt disgusted that most of my coworkers were not taking it seriously and our store is not requiring masks for customers despite it being state law or having cleaning done. I was working for 8 hours and I did not see one person clean anything. 



I am in my mid 20s but I was a premature baby whose lungs were not fully developed and had to stay in the hospital for a month, was a smoker and when I do get sick I'm sick for awhile. I know I won't die but there still is a chance of getting really sick. Social distancing and wearing a mask is just the right thing to do. I just don't understand how one can be so oblivious to the world. 




I have really bad anxiety and I feel like I can't even bring up my concerns. I don't want to tell a person how to live there life but this is affecting every facet of my life right now because of the behavior of one person. 



I really don't know what to do. I thought the roommate would change when my girlfriend got back but nothing has. I don't want to live there anymore nor do I want this to ruin our relationship. I'm not on the lease so I have no legal obligation.",2020-06-20 13:25:34

My parents and I are high risk, more so them. There are moving plans to a new house in the area. I got talked into going along being told it was going to be one on one.

I saw the crowd and immediately wanted to leave. My dad is stubborn and bowled in. I went after to try and convince him to leave. The house was the ugliest thing I'd ever seen anyway. Not even worth the anxiety of going in. I should have just left but I got guilted into staying.

It apparently had 20+ people yesterday from one realtor alone. When we went it was 3 realtors crowding at once and a whole huge family of idiots without masks. My dad is 65+ and doesn't understand.

We wore masks the whole time but no one else did.

I've had an anxiety attack since yesterday and I'm refusing any more of this shit. I was dragged into this against my will and feel ambushed as hell. I'm furious tbh.

I could really go for reassurance of any sort.

351,For those who got it via direct sneeze or know someone who did,3,hchkiw,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hchkiw/for_those_who_got_it_via_direct_sneeze_or_know/,0,"So my mom practically sneezed on me this past Monday morning, it wasn't right on me, but she was standing literally right next to me. She attempted to cover her mouth with her elbow but I don't know if it was fully covered, I was only in the room for a minute tops after she sneezed and I immediately left to go like 4 rooms down for 3 hours till it was safe, but I was still just right next to her during the sneeze.

My mom has been in quarantine with me since March and we have not left the house since,(We have our own personal driver to grocery shop for us) not so for my dad though. He's the main breadwinner in our family so he's been coming and going, granted he's been wearing a N95 out everywhere and says he only meets with clients who wear masks while always doing the 6ft or more social distancing guideline, and makes sure to stay away from everyone else during mandatory visits to the bank but who knows. The really insidious thing about this virus is the fact that it spreads asymptomatically, and like completely asymptomatically, or so I've recently heard, not even just ""pre-symptomatically"" so even if my parents never show symptoms, they could still potentially be asymptomatic carriers capable of spreading it.

What's more my mom had her own slip-up this Friday. She usually has no contact with our driver, having him leave the groceries on our porch and ring the bell to let us know he's here so to slide his payment under the door. This time though she opened the door to talk to him. He was standing 6 ft away outside with a mask, but my mom was on our doorstep where he had just put down the groceries and who knows if he wears that mask all the time when not around people, so he could've very well breathed out aerosols on the porch and my mom didn't wait long enough like she usually does to allow it dissipate. (She usually waits 15 minutes after he leaves to open the door to take in the groceries, granted here she only talked to him for 5 minutes tops till I caught her in the act and hastily reminded her to come back inside)

Basically I'm scared shitless, especially after I've been hearing so much about initial viral load being a big determining factor, and apparently sneezes house the most virus particles? I mean I'm young (28) and female at a very healthy weight for my height with no preexisting conditions that I'm aware of so I already have those on my side at least but I'm also unfortunately severely Vitamin D deficient (my doctor once said they're at dangerous levels) and now possibly got exposed via the worst way possible?

That's why I come to you not asking my likelihood in getting infected, (I'll ultimately have to wait 2 weeks for that anyways) but if you or someone you know got infected via someone sneezing right next to them, did any of them get a ""mild"" case or were even possibly asymptomatic? Basically I wanna know if it's possible to still get mild symptoms or be completely symptom free even with initial exposure to a high viral load? Or are the milds and asymptomatics only those who got it through someone else just talking or breathing?",2020-06-20 11:05:45

Movie theaters. Bars. Most restaurants. Meeting up with more than one friend at a time. Parties. Concerts. Mass gatherings. Shooting new TV and films. Meeting new people in person. Dating. Sex. Touch. These things are all effectively dead until we get a vaccine, and considering that we might never get one, they might be gone forever. Even if we do get one, it will take years, and by then I think they'll die on their own. People are getting used to not going out. They're adapting. And the institutions that used to support these things will crumble if they have to stay out of business for that long.

I don't see a way out of this that doesn't end in a sadder, smaller, and more miserable world, and I'm starting to crumble at the realization that this is the rest of my life. I had one year of good things, and now it's just going to be video games and old reruns and Zoom, forever. Every time I think about it, I fucking collapse, and every day a life of despair just feels more inevitable. A vaccine will take years, and that's if we're lucky, and then we have to distribute it, which will take several more years. And by then, almost everything about pre-2020 life will have fundamentally changed. Restaurants and bars and theaters will have all closed up shop, and everyone will be too poor to open new ones, if anyone even wants to - because if another pandemic can come along and shut you down, what's even the point? There is no way out of it, and it is not hard to do the math. Even the countries that seem to have beaten it, like New Zealand and South Korea, had to walk it back after huge new spikes. There is no solution except indefinite lockdown. Indefinite lockdown means economic collapse. Indefinite lockdown means poverty. Indefinite lockdown means relentless misery. There is no end. Everyone seems to be in mass denial that this is not just a six-months inconvenience, but the end of the world as we know it.  Everyone is acting like we will be fine in six months, and not like the only way out is to never go out, forever, for years. Everyone is telling me to try and look on the bright side and talk to people on Zoom, as if that could ever be a goddamn substitute, as if I'm not allowed to be miserable that Zoom is the only way I'll be able to interact with anyone except my parents for maybe the next fucking decade. I feel like it's mid-March again, where I'm the only one yelling that things are going to change forever, and everyone is patting me on the head and telling me I'm being sensationalist and pessimistic and things will turn out just fine, because they can't \*really\* be that bad! I'm at the point where I want to bite the head off of anyone telling me to look on the bright side, because they're just reframing the truth of the situation - that we will have to suffer, without end, to save lives, that endless isolation and suffering is the only ethical way forward, that the very best we can do is wait for some deus ex machina that might happen at some point in the future and might not happen at all, and this is what we have to do. This is the only moral thing to do. This is the only way to live without killing strangers. We have to do it. We have to just take it. There is no way to alleviate it without being morally complicit in somebody's painful death.

Yes, I know we're reopening. It's not safe and won't last. Yes, I know humanity will survive. We'll just all be a lot more tribal and miserable. I know I should shut up and be grateful and accept the daily, indefinite emotional anguish of lockdown for as long as it takes, and I feel selfish for even complaining, because the alternative to all of these things is mass death. But I can't handle it, because I'm weak. I keep fixating on all the lasts I had in March - last time at a theater, last meal out, last night out, last time I saw my friends in person, last party - and realizing that they're not just last-for-nows, but last-evers. I'm just miserable and mourning the past and fearing the future all day, every day.",2020-06-19 18:43:41

I had found a book on my shelves that i really didn’t know where it came from but it looked interesting so i started it, a few days ago.. it was second in a series of three...   i finished it and it was okay... the story was interesting but some parts were not all that believable ...nevertheless, i did want to know how the story ends in the third book so i went looking for an ebook on the internet... well  haha first i went to goodreads and discovered that almost everyone hated the third book, that it was boring and repetitive, but the last 30 pages were really interesting because of a surprising tragic twist!

well!   curiousity whetted, i was looking for a plot treatment that would just tell me about that game changing tragedy but noooooo they all cannot divulge the plot on a 10 year old failed book... grrr

so i then went looking for the ebook and thought i had found one in my library but noooo  it was only an audiobook and i just couldnt be bothered with that...  

so then i discovered that there was a hard copy in my library.

now, my library system has been closed but, when it opened a couple of weeks ago, decided we could take out books if they were on our shelves (ie nothing from other libraries)   

so i sent a friend to get it and now i have it.  

but i can’t open it haha and read it because you know.. germs..  

so i have it open and out in the sun and occasionally i go out and flip a few pages lolol   because the sun will disinfect..

and now the sun is disappearing behind some clouds...

i am contemplating putting the book inside a very clear big plastic bag (i don’t even know if i have one lol) and then reading the crucial 30 pages that way...

I’m now at my layover airport in Dallas and feeling kinda stressed. It’s crazy busy here and impossible to social distance. I board my home bound flight in 40 minutes.

UPDATE TWO: I made it home! Second flight though slightly more crowded was fine. I actually enjoyed it. So in all the only stressful part was Dallas Love Field.

She has been my best friend for over 20 years but we have been distant for a while and especially since this pandemic started. I am worried this will end our entire friendship, but I don't feel comfortable going to something that could be moved to another time that would possibly harm myself or many other people.

Edit: I should note that this is just a reception for her wedding. They did not want anyone at their ceremony so they planned to elope in Hawaii. They technically are already married since they signed the paperwork in March before they postponed everything. So they are just doing this reception to please other people according to them.

366,Someone in my house just tested positive and I feel terrible for visiting family outside this week.,15,hbjpsc,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hbjpsc/someone_in_my_house_just_tested_positive_and_i/,10,"Wall of text because I’m fucking panicked. The family members I (22M) live with have not been taking the virus very seriously, whereas I have not been to the grocery store since March and have been trying my best to stay home and haven’t been inside a home I didn’t live in since March. In fact, I was going to go out hiking today but called my mom about something unrelated and she told me about the positive test while she was eating out at a restaurant. Last week, my family invited over my brother who lives in town and he wanted to play basketball with me on our hoop outside. I reluctantly obliged, knowing that if I hadn’t, my family would have been very angry with me. 

About a month ago I was in self isolation for 10 days because my throat was a little scratchy, but since I’ve been sneezing and had a persistent scratchy throat, I figured that it was probably allergies or something. Plus, I have a deviated septum which apparently can cause dry throat and stuff. Before this week, I had been vehemently checking my temperature and have not had a fever or a cough or any symptoms. Nobody in my home (including the positive test) have had any symptoms outside of allergies. The person whose test came back positive gets tested every week because of their job and got their first positive test two days ago. 

Yesterday, I woke up with a nasal cavity that was in pain (not unusual for me before covid, with my deviated septum and my tendency to sleep with my mouth open). I also had a bit of a headache but was really hungry and, when I ate, it seemed to go away. So I thought it was a hunger headache. I have OCD, anxiety, and depression, and in the middle of the worst of the pandemic (May), I started ERP therapy. ERP therapy is all about exposing yourself to your worst fears (mine was giving someone covid, which caused me to lock myself in my room for self isolation despite having symptoms that could easily be attributed to something else and my nurse doubting that I had it because I had been in my home with a negative tested person for a long time). So, over time, I’ve been trying to grow more comfortable visiting others while taking precautions, though I still refuse to go into anyone’s house.

This Tuesday, after my father just lost his job that he had for 28 years, I decided to go drive over to his house and visit him to make him even a little happier, and spent about an hour with him outside while wearing a mask and staying roughly 6 feet apart (though for a few moments it was more like 3-4 and I feel really fucking bad for that). He also asked me to hold my dog’s leash for a few minutes at one point and I did and pet my dog once and gave the leash back to him, so I’m worried that he may have gotten it from that. He lives with someone who has several issues that would complicate recovery and I worry for him too, especially since he loves my dog. 

Later that night, and last night as well, I went over to my grandparents’ house and visited them (also outside). I mostly maintained a 10 foot distance or so, though I got to 6 feet at times. I also wore a mask, but it was the same mask that I have worn a couple times before and don’t know if it has degraded too much. I’m not as worried about them getting it, and they continue to self isolate as they have been for 3 months. Neither of them leave the house for anything at all, and have been ordering groceries and stuff since this started.

As for me, I’m for sure going to be staying home for at least a month, and I’ve made sure to tell my brother and his dad and my grandparents about the positive test. I tried calling my father (who is at lunch with his old boss), but he didn’t answer, so I texted him in all caps about the situation. I feel awful about trying to ignore my potential symptoms, and am now worried about how many I lives I may have endangered. I’ve been trying to get more accustomed to slowly easing myself out of quarantine over these last couple of months by visiting people outside and such, but what if I just killed my grandparents or my dad or his roommate from my negligence? I know mortality rates are fairly low, but I just feel like an awful, shitty person and I don’t know how to live with myself.

Edit: Also, I’m sorry for the disorganized text. I’m just in a panic.",2020-06-18 22:02:19

Idk if this is necessary I know cats are susceptible to their own coronavirus but that quite a few animals have caught COVID19 from their humans.

369,Moving back home during pandemic.,12,hbguje,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hbguje/moving_back_home_during_pandemic/,17,"Hi all. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, so let me know if not! I just want to share an experience I've had in relation to this pandemic and see if there's anyone else out their who's found themselves in a similar situation. Apologies in advance for the rambling!

Basically, I'm in my mid-twenties and finally moved out of my parents' house earlier this year. It was a big deal for me to move out. It was something I planned for quite a while and was very excited about. Once I moved, I was really enjoying my new place. I found a roommate that I got along with great. I was exploring the new city I'd moved to a lot, meeting tons of new people and potential new friends, having a generally good time, and really enjoying my newfound independence and sense of responsibility.

Then, when the pandemic hit in March, I decided to move back in with my family temporarily so that I could be part of their isolation ""bubble"" for however long this lasted. The way I saw it, if I stayed in my new place, I'd risk more exposure to the virus through my roommate, who seems to be careful but not quite as cautious as I've been. It also meant I wouldn't be able to see my family for the duration of the pandemic, since some of my family members are in high risk groups and I wouldn't want to risk contaminating them if I was unknowingly exposed to the virus through my roommate. So I packed a few clothes and things and came home. I'm still paying for my place and all my stuff is there, and I intend to move back whenever it's safe too, although I don't really know when that will be.

Although it has been very hard at times, I'm generally very happy that I decided to come home since staying in my new place would've been extremely isolating (even with my roommate there; we don't actually know each other that well yet) and stressful. Not being able to see my family through all of this and worrying about them constantly would've also been incredibly miserable. I probably would've felt a lot of guilt about not coming home, too, given the severity of the situation.

That being said, I sometimes feel...I'm not sure if the right word is embarrassed, but I guess kind of embarrassed...that when I finally got myself to actually move out, my plans and independence were just kind of squashed a few months later. I feel like I was a little late in moving out compared to some of my peers, so it felt really good to finally do it and start developing the independence I've been eager to develop for so long. And then to end up back home just a few months later, it just feels...like a let down I guess, and like I failed in some way. I know this is totally illogical, since moving home due to an unprecedented pandemic in no way reflects on my ability to live independently on my own. It's just how I feel sometimes, I guess. And it's how I worry others view me, too. It's also pretty frustrating to continue paying for a place that I'm not even using. I feel like I'm paying for a great, fun, exciting life that I'm not even able to live right now. (Although it's worth noting that even if I was still living there, I wouldn't be doing anything out besides going for walks and grocery shopping, basically). I also wonder sometimes if I'll realistically be able to move back before my lease ends in the Fall.

I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for here. Maybe just some reassurance that I'm not a ""failure"" because of what's happened, and some reassurance that my life will eventually get ""back on track"" at some point? And if anyone is or knows someone who is in a similar situation, it'd be nice to hear from you too! I just don't have any friends who've done this (they either still live at home, or live on their own but didn't go back home to stay with family). It'd be nice to know I'm not the only one who made this choice, I guess, and that it seems like a reasonable choice to other people besides myself haha. Thanks for reading!

It talks about how huge numbers of young adults have moved home during the pandemic, and reasons why doing so maybe shouldn't be as stigmatized as it is. Enjoy!

I just wanted to get the anxiety I'm feeling off my chest in a safe environment.

I've been pretty anxious about the pandemic since late February and then it only got worse as the months progressed. I started seeing a therapist to help channel the anxiety, depression, and OCD tendencies that were just overruling my life.

I got to a point where I was doing really good.  I had to go into the office 3 times a week, and I always wore my mask and washed my hands before eating or touching my face. In fact, I was washing my hands so much to the point that they were so dry and tender. I worked hard to maintain my distance from others in the office who weren't wearing masks (which was most of them).

Turns out one of my coworkers, who didn't wear a mask, tested positive this previous Sunday (6/14). I haven't seen this person since 6/8 so at this point it has been about 9 days since exposure. I do not have any symptoms to speak of.  My wife (also symptom-free) and I were tested the day we found out about my exposure (6/14) and they said it would be about 4-5 days until we received our results, which is really making this a whole lot worse than it needs to be. The doctors didn't seem very concerned about my exposure due to my normal vitals and every day that passes where everything is normal makes me feel hopeful. But then the hopeful turns into extreme panic and it's just a never-ending cycle.

I'm really scared about being sick. I am so afraid of the idea of being sick that this whole experience has just been weighing on me like a cinderblock. Waiting for the results is one of the most awful experiences of my life so far.",2020-06-18 01:09:45

All of us have pretty bad OI so good pillows are a must for both sleeping in ways to keep our blood pressure high and not dislocating joints.  Certain pillow work better then others, I usually am able to find some good ones at Ross, TJmaxx,  or tuesday Morming and at a good price (since right now money is tighter then normal). 

I did go out in Late January and grabbed 4 pillows , when people were buying up other things but I am now out since we have 3 people needing them. 

Where is a safe place to buy? TJmaxx is out because lines are still hours long to check out. Ross and tuesday morning where I live have so many unattended kids touching things. I can't wash the pillow, because after 2 washes no matter on what cycle the pillows are ruined. I want a pillow that has not been touched by random people  and is sealed perferrably. Or if I bought a lets say Ross and felt the pillow had been touched and I left it in my shortage room for a week , would it be safe?

I feel like his mother.",74,hahw7v,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hahw7v/boyfriend_guilting_me_to_let_him_see_his_family/,40,"So my parents, both in their late 60s, came to visit two months ago or so. I know for a fact that they quarantine, I speak to my dad every day and he bleached his groceries before they come in the door.

This left my boyfriend to say he wanted to see his family. He has 5 siblings, his mom and dad.
They all claim to quarantine, but I doubt it. His sibling SOs also come to the household, so that’s 8 people we have to trust to be doing the right thing.

I ended up agreeing that he could  go, and it was awful. His car was totaled on the way back, and then he exposed himself to firemen on top of everything else.

When he got back, he had intestinal issues and his “jaw” swelled up like orange size. I was sure it was his lymph nodes but he insisted he pulled his jaw muscle. 

I was SO pissed that I hadn’t listened to my instincts. He was better in a couple of days, and I didn’t develop any symptoms, but it was more that I let myself get talked into this shit and realizing the potential consequences were not worth it to me. I was terrified I was going to get the virus.

He claimed he should never have gone, he should’ve just listened to me, that he would’ve been pissed but it would’ve been better than having gone.

Now he is doing the same thing. Asking me every day even though I say no each time. 

It frustrating because even in March, I told him “things are going to open back up, you’re going to want to go out, please listen to me.” I said this given the fact that I was an early preparer and he laughed at me and didn’t think it was a big deal until his coworker agreed with him.

I know this sounds annoying, but I HATE having to be proven right each time. I was proven right, then again he said he should’ve listened to me, now he’s trying to go out again.

My main concern is that I live in TX where cases are skyrocketing and I know at least some of his family is not social distancing. His brother is on my Venmo and he is sending money to his friends for tacos and beers and stuff. 

No one likes to stay home! He said “some people don’t get the privilege to isolate” and I said WELL WE DO! How many times do I have to prove that I know what I’m talking about? 

I know this is stupid but I’m genuinely rethinking the relationship. He made fun of me, guilted me the first time, and is guilting me again? The first time he left was beyond stressful. He got into an accident, he developed symptoms and I was terrified I had it. I just don’t feel like he is good at protecting me or giving up his selfish desires when shit hits the fan. I’ve never felt like were in this together—more like I’m his mother preventing him from doing what he wants.

He always says “those types of things don’t happen to me.” His car wreck was literally the first thing that’s ever been bad enough for him to say “maybe they do happen to me.” 

I don’t have anything that weakens my immune system, but I get the flu frequently—and it lasts weeks and get about one bad infection a year. It is normal for me to get over 100 temperature. I’ve had kidney infections, typhus, constant infections and illnesses. So I get sick frequently and I know how much it sucks, and I DONT want to fucking get Covid. He is one of those people that gets sick once every five years. 

Last time I had 104 fever, you know when it takes effort to even reach for aspirin, he decided to go visit his family three hours away and I went to the doctor. I called him crying to come back because the doctors couldn’t find out what was wrong. I was just genuinely scared, you know what it’s like when your sick, and felt alone. 

They ended up giving me a steroid shot that made me feel better in hours, and he was annoyed that he had to drive back. But why did I have to drive myself to the doctors with 104 fever in the first place? He says that I need to learn to take care of myself, yet here I am, trying to do that, and he won’t comply.

We got into a huge fight and he said he can do whatever the fuck he wants and he’s sick of being in this house and just wants to escape. I don’t feel like I have a partner. I don’t feel like we’re in this together. He will likely be pissed at me and bitter that he can’t go, and we haven’t even reached the peak of this shit yet. 

I don’t have the greatest relationship with my parents, but maybe it would at least be better than being here.",2020-06-17 06:06:39

I lived in an apt with three of my best friends and they all went home to live with their family. I began quarantining with my boyfriend and it didn’t hit me how big of a deal this was but we took all precautions. By mid-April, I found out he was cheating on me multiple times before the quarantine. I had a complete mental breakdown and moved back home. So yeah it was just a rough time for me. 

My family is such a great support system but the way my mom is an essential worker at a clinic, my dad leaves the house often to go interact with so many people for no reason, makes me so so anxious. I constantly feel like any second we will get this virus and I will lose both my parents (age 50) or I (19) just won’t recover and I’ll die. I’ve never felt anxiety or depression my entire life until now. 

I’m so scared. The uncertainty is eating me up alive. Luckily, I’m so close to my parents and talk to them often about my feelings but they still don’t do anything to socially distance. My boyfriend and I talked so much and worked things out and he’s actually my biggest support system right now, calming me down during my anxiety attacks. 

I’ve self isolated for the past 4 months but broke that last week to see my boyfriend for a night(we both are negative.) and it helped so so much. But I still feel so guilty. I just don’t know what to do. About anything. About college classes resuming in the fall or literally any aspect of my life. I feel so alone. I feel like I’m going to die or one of my loved ones.

It makes a long day very difficult. 

The disposable masks fit better, are far more comfortable, are fast to put on and take off, and I can wear an ear saver with them! I LOVE them! But, I am an eco conscious person and I was wondering if there is a better option to just throwing them in the trash? Can they be composted? Recycled in anyway?

I can only see people’s eyes, and whenever I wear one I feel like I can’t breathe too well (typical, ik)

Sure it's nice to talk about it to my girl who has been a huge help just with her being a big part of my life and we have brought each other a lot of love and care for one another.   


It's just lately things still feel very dull. Perhaps it's doing the same mundane routine without being able to go out to have fun to take a break from working and being stuck at home all the time. Not being able to travel to places that you loved to visit because of the virus. Honestly even if someone now were to ask me to come and hang out I just don't even have the desire to go anywhere. Now that I've just been a part of this going to work and going straight back to home routine it's just become part of my life now. It's weird right that you think someone who is depressed being at home and work all the time would want to go out, but at the same time you're concerned about the virus or your just so used to staying at home that it keeps me from wanting to go out.   


I am sorry I am sure what I am saying doesn't make sense and that it's the same feelings I share almost in every post, but lately that is how I have been feeling with nothing really changing about it. Honestly I would say the only time I am happy is when I am with my girl, but I know I can't be with her 24/7 and it just doesn't help that both of our work schedules keep us pretty busy. I am honestly at the point where a lot of the time I just break down and cry or I don't feel the same enjoyment I've felt when it's come to my interests whether they were indoor or outdoor interests. It almost just feels like the virus has taken the joy out of my life and I am sorry it's selfish to even think that way when I should be grateful that I am alive and healthy. Guess in my mind if I can't be happy then what's really the point in living other than to be with those around you that love and care for you.

We've had to keep up our work this entire time, and my wife has been getting slammed with 80 hour weeks.

Day 1.
I had to work this weekend and she told me that she wasn't feeling well and she called in sick. In the morning (I work night shift) I bring her home some pepto, crackers and ginger ale to help her feel better. 

Day 2.
She feels a little better, but not well enough to go back. I told her that enough is enough, she's not riding this out and I'm taking her to a doctor tomorrow. 

Day 3. 
I made an appointment for her to see a doctor and they swabbed her and gave her something for her stomach and diarrhea. I go to work a little late, having to get her medication and take her home. 

My sister in law calls me at job, and tells me that my wife is telling me that she can't breathe and I instantly start panicking. I call my lieutenant and try to complete my work up unto that point and jet home. My wife was pale, barely coherent, had vomited, had severe stomach pain and her skin was cold to the touch. I was so scared that I dialed 9 11 and they came and got her.

By the time all was said and done, the hospital had as good of an idea as I did as to what the fuck just happened. They printed her out GERD paperwork because they have no idea what's wrong.

I've NEVER seen her this bad off, and I've never felt such a desperate terror than I did last night. I feel so guilty, I put my job before her and I ought to be ashamed of myself.

I'm so scared, I feel like I've cried two dozen times this morning. I'm terrified that it's COVID19 because I've seen reports of people feeling sick for a while, getting better and then just nosediving.

All this time waiting for the final test result, he had bad headaches and no appetite. They finally gave him some pills after they told him the result.

The whole time he was at home, me and my mom had permanent contact with him, but we're not having any symptoms; and we surely have a poorer immunity.

My question is, what are the chances for first test to be negative, but the second one to be positive, with the blood draw minutes after the first quick test?

I started a new job 3 weeks before the lockdown here in NYC. My new boss only closed our salon because she had to by law in NY State; (I'm sure she still saw clients on the low). Within those 3 weeks, during discussions about the pending situation, talking about such things as taking the subway and how serious this virus is, she made comments such as, ""I don't get sick"" and ""I don't take the subway."" I thought to myself, ""well some of us do and have to!""

Phase 2, which is scheduled to reopen soon, applies to such business as salons. Clients who receive hair and nail services, for example, can wear masks because the area being worked on is not the face. I do facials and makeup, so it is impossible for clients to wear a mask when receiving these services. I will of course wear protective gear, but I am still very worried as my partner is high risk. He has been working from home from the beginning, has a good job at a great company that actually cares about their employees and is not forcing anyone to come in. But, as we know, not all jobs can be done remotely.

I have health issues myself and if I got the virus, I know I would be very sick. I know my boyfriend, and he agrees, would have a very hard time surviving it; he is very high risk with co-morbidities.

I have been in the salon industry for a long time. It is a very unstable sector; the abuse is rife. I am looking to get out anyway, and have been taking online courses to change careers. But, I need income for school. The owner is funny about putting things in writing and we signed a non-compete, but no paperwork concerning my hours, pay, benefits, commission, etc. I got the basics verbally and the manager asked the owner twice to give me the figures for other important aspects regarding my pay.

I haven't heard from the owner until today, she wants to speak at the end of this week. She wanted to rush back right away when there was talk of reopening even before Albany said anyone was allowed to go out. I know for a fact that this position offers no health insurance and it is not like when I go back I will be fully booked to make $ since I make an amount per client and clients are not going to rush in. Millions are still out of work and during a time of crisis, people are worried about groceries and the luxuries go first. I have no access to a car, the subway is the only way to get to work.

Finally, my boyfriend will completely flip if I go back to work and/or take the subway because he is worried for the both of us.

So, what should I do? Should I buy time? What should I do if there is a resurgence in the Fall? Is this job actually worth it?

Thank you all so much for your time and help.",2020-06-16 19:41:55

392,Support and validated resources needed for looking after daughter this summer.,6,ha0jt6,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ha0jt6/support_and_validated_resources_needed_for/,8,"So this is going to be quite a long read, but what I’m looking for is as much “science” as possible in order to come up with a plan to reduce risk.

Here’s the situation. I live in a country outside the US. My 13 year old daughter lives with her mother in New York State. We went through a very acrimonious divorce and every time it is my time (five weeks over the summer) with my daughter, the mother tries to do everything in her power to taint it. Even ten years after the divorce was finalised, last year, she issued a summons to family court in order to reduce this contact. The petition was, within minutes, withdrawn when her legal team realised that the grounds were completely unarguable.  She gave me no notice or warning of what the hearing was about and in no way tried to discuss it beforehand. So that’s the kind of person we are dealing with here. The daughter has suffered from asthma, but it is now managed very well. 

Usually what happens is that I fly to New York, pick up daughter and then fly back to my home city where we spend five fantastic weeks with my family, friends etc etc. At the end, I fly back with her, drop her off then return.

Now of course, this year is the year of the pandemic. The mother has put the fear of god into the daughter (as she does with anything to be honest), and the daughter is absolutely terrified of flying internationally. (Interestingly, she actually considered
flying domestically to Florida, California etc, but I think she may now realise that’s very similar). 

Now let’s start looking at the factors. Five weeks board and lodgings in the USA is not going to be cheap. Not that this is my primary concern, but it’s a consideration. Let’s just say it’s 100 USD / night for both of us. If I consider staying in the USA, where would the best place for us to stay be? It would have to be a state that has good virus management as well as some level of activities which are open (and take into consideration the guidelines etc). It would also have to be a state that isn’t fabricating their stats. Also, how would I get there and what level of risk would this involve? If driving, then there is the interactions at each stop. Additionally, at the place we stay, how do I ensure that interactions there are safe enough?

The converse to this is arrange flights back to my home city where I have the support network and comforts, security etc of my own home. But this involves flying from New York for around eight hours (and back, obviously). I am ok with doing that leg by myself (I have no choice, tbh, if I want to see my daughter), but the mother has put such fear into the daughter then she is very very anxious about it, and then of course the mother can leverage this by stating that I do not care about the feelings and emotional welfare of the daughter (which she is doing now).

The mother would like nothing better for me to cancel the trip and then proclaim that I don’t really care about the daughter and never put her first. She would also use this as further leverage between daughter and I.

So… what I am looking for are:

1. Accurate as possible statistics and science behind flying, the risks and mitigations etc.
2. Ideas about where to travel to from NY for up to five weeks, and how best to travel to those places.
3. A tiny bit of support from people who have been in my daughter’s situation who can offer me some positivity about my situation

The only word I received from her nursing home staff was that she was ""feeling better.""  Last year, however, while being in the acute care hospital, she welcomed as much as she could allow, all visitors, messages, etc.

I have been terribly worried about my mom since the beginning of this. I even took away her car keys and hid them for a month because I didn't want her leaving the house. My sister has suffered greatly throughout all of this. She suffers from depression and needs social interaction to make her happy aka a sense of community like work. She returned to her restaurant job about 3 weeks ago, and since then just doesn't seem to care at ALL anymore about Covid-19 and attempting to keep my mom safe. All she cares about is reviving her social life.

&#x200B;

I literally go to bed and wake up worried if today is going to the be the day that anyone of us catches it and shows symptoms. We've been fighting a lot and I compromised and let her spend a day with her friend outside by her friend pool. This girl has not quarantined ONCE since this all started so that in itself is risky. When I dropped her off it was also revealed there were two other people there and when I went to pick her up she didn't see me, but she hugged her friend which reallllllllllllly upset me. It's shit like this that makes me think what is she doing at work that I don't know about. She says she doesn't care anymore because she can't take staying inside. She doesn't drive, but she wants to start taking ubers to go out more.

UGH.

(Asking Serious Questions, Not Obvious)",3,h9mn20,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/h9mn20/how_to_keep_ourselves_safe_asking_serious/,3,"Hello, I have recently lost my close-uncle to Coronavirus (with no underlying illness) which has made me question a lot of questions to expert and experienced people.

**QUESTION BEFORE TEST BUT DOUBTFUL OF BEING POSITIVE:**

A. Let's say, John is showing symptoms of Coronavirus already. He should be tested (for COVID-19) within how many days since suspected?

B. When we should consider having him admitted to the hospital?

**QUESTIONS AFTER TEST BEING POSITIVE:**

C. Now that John is tested positive with mild-symptoms, with no critical care is required. How do we make sure his health doesn't worsen?

D. How do we make sure when John needs to be hospitalized? (What are the signs)?

**QUESTIONS WHICH ARE NOT CATEGORIZED:**

E. I'm not trying to be doctor, but how do actually most of the coronavirus patients are getting saved/cured meanwhile, 2-5% of the patients are dying (which makes mostly those who were in critical care).

What actually decides that who's going to die and who's going to make it? (I am asking this question in a wrong way because of language barrier but I hope you understand what I'm trying to ask).

Because, my uncle and his family were all positive. But, only my uncle required the critical care meanwhile, his whole family is in home isolation (probably, going to be cured).

The question I'm asking is because, there is no cure right? There is no medicine? So how can almost 95% of the people are getting cured? What are the factors?

P.S.: I am sorry if I have asked any question which is wrong or not to ask, but I am right now bit grieving yet I have taken responsibility that no one else in my family dies because of it. Someone has to take the step to teach people at home about the right things and wrong things. People specially in many countries are lacking knowledge about it. (Specially South Asia) Also, my questions might make little off-sense because English is not my mother tongue.

\-Is it too much to ask that anyone who handles my cats have on a mask and fresh gloves? (They're not allowing pet parents inside unless it's for emergency stuff, so I won't be going in and there won't be other people around already)

\-Am I overreacting? What's the actual risk here?

403,As a Regional Manager for one of America's top franchise gym brands I am terrified of our clubs opening.,14,h93iz9,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/h93iz9/as_a_regional_manager_for_one_of_americas_top/,2," Obviously this is a throwaway account for job security purposes. I am a Regional Manager for one of America's top gym brands in New Jersey. The particular chain I am currently employed with is definitely one of the cleanest in the industry.

The reasons I am terrified of our clubs re-opening:

1. Our entry level staff is paid minimum wage and usually don't put in too much effort outside of the bare minimum. Which means if a shift lead or manager isn't actively watching them, they are more than likely slacking off. Even our most eager staff members can't put in the effort that will be required of them to keep everything clean on minimum wage, it's not worth it. The MC'Ds and burger king next door pay the same and sometimes higher for what will soon be less labor.
2. It would only take one of my extremely negligent member to infect and cause a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. I would say 2/10 of our members actually take the few extra seconds to re-rack dumbells / weights / plates and probably only 5/10 members that actually clean up after themselves.
3. Members think that it is humanely possible for our limited staff members to clean up after each of them like a premium house maid. NOT POSSIBLE, we can't have a specific staff member cleaning up every dribble of spit, sweat, and god knows what else coming out of a member's orifice at all times.
4. Our clubs and almost every club in NJ do not have negative air pressure.
5. Ventilation systems are not connected to every machine, meaning all of that awesome bodily mist that is circulating is making round trips and landing on ALL our member's belongings and their bodies. Staff members are also not exempt from this non-discriminating barrage.
6. I have physically deep cleaned a location by myself. It took me about 7 hours to get done with 60% of the gym, that was after a cleaning crew had already swept through the gym once. I was still finding residue on machines. Once again, for an active location, let alone a 24 hour location getting everything sanitized will not actually be possible. Many of the chemicals known to destroy COVID-19 and our safe for our equipment require a certain amount of time to settle and do their jobs. Which means we can't just spray a machine down and let someone on it instantly.
7. There is no way of keeping our club members anger free if we have a max occupancy of 25\~50 in locations that have unique logins surpassing 1k every day. ESPECIALLY if we can't limit the amount of time someone can be within the building. (The logistical problem of keeping track of people and enforcing a time limit policy is a whole different ball game) People will get angry that they can't get in, and someone WILL be having a bad day and someone WILL do something stupid on that said bad day.
8. So much more, but everyone gets the gyst of it right? It only takes one bad seed to kill countless human lives. I would say 70% of our members are careless and thoughtless, I shiver at the thought of them potentially being near me, many of our members are the same people that went to miami for spring break during the outbreak, think about that.

Honestly the only way I would be comfortable with gyms re-opening would be on these terms:

1. Apps for every gym franchise that would allow people to schedule their workouts in advance on a first-come first serve basis.
2. A policy in place that would allow us to enforce time-limits.
3. Raises for my junior staff members that will motivate them to actually care.
4. Policies that would allow us to have a member removed from premises if they don't wear masks, don't follow time-limit guidelines, and those that threaten my staff members in ANY WAY, whether intentional or not.

I'm thinking about quitting my job due to this pandemic I have a pregnant wife at home and elderly parents that visit often, I don't want to be the reason I lose loved ones. Even if I do everything correctly it would only take one drop of sweat at the wrong place at the wrong time for me to potentially harm my family.

I really hope this goes viral, If i were able to get Gov. Murphey in NJ to somehow get a hold of this that would be even more amazing. If mods need proof of employment I am willing to disclose that information in private.",2020-06-15 02:45:13

One of the things that I really look forward in life is traveling, going to the movies and just enjoying life outside my house and I think it I will never would be able to enjoy any of it again because of the insane restrictions, for example the 14 day quarantine while visiting another country, 2 meters space in a place that cannot do that

There are literally no good news at all, for example, if any good news at all comes out it gets zero attention on the media and in /r/coronavirus but if theres news that 50 new cases have appear in NYC it gets like 5k upvotes and the media saying that we should never lift the lockdowns.

I don't understand how everyone keeps normalizing things like the unemployment rate, mental consequences of not leaving home for 3 months, the mass histeria, insulting people who went to protest because ""we are all going to die"" the ""new normal"", mask use 24/7 till there's a vaccine or saying that this will stay like this until we get a vaccine WHAT IF WE NEVER GET A VACCINE???

Cases are spiking in my state, stuff's still open, people are still easing up, and I know logically I'm at waaaay more risk than any point in the last few months. Doing anything except ramping *up* my caution level feels straight up absurd. But I just...can't. I'm so tired. I'm so burnt out from anxiety, in a mental tailspin from isolation, spending most of my non-work time lying around in a depressive stupor because *hey, not like there's any reason to go out, right?*. I can feel my resolve slipping- little things, lingering in a store longer than I need to, going places just for the sake of going, thinking about taking the bus again. I know I shouldn't. I know I *will*. I try to justify myself- I'm young and healthy, I'll get through it. I'll catch it at work eventually anyways, this won't make a difference. I wear a mask and distance diligently, I'm not likely to spread it around to someone vulnerable...

Thing is, I *know* this is BS. I *know*. And I know what the comments are going to be- ""it's nowhere near over, just keep pushing through, don't give into the pressure"". Which is true! The facts line up! But, honestly, if you're going to say that...please, please, don't. You're right, and it hurts, but it doesn't change the fact that I just...can't. I can't. I hate that, I hate that I'm not just fine in my perfectly nice house like so many others are. I've tried, but I'm not. And, ironically? The stress of knowing exactly how bad the situation is is just makes me feel *more* burnt out, and makes it *harder* to keep going!

[https://thegoodnewscoronavirus.com](https://thegoodnewscoronavirus.com)

And

[https://www.justgivemepositivenews.com](https://www.justgivemepositivenews.com)

Which is good news in itself! Remember for those of you who want to look for good news on other coronavirus-related subreddits but don't know how to filter out the rest, this link will take you direct to only the stories that have been flared 'Good News' on r/coronavirus:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/?f=flair\_name%3A%22Good%20News%22](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/?f=flair_name%3A%22Good%20News%22)

It's noticeable, however, that we often used to have dozens of positive stories posted here each week and this seems to have diminished - there were none last week - but they are out there, as the two links above show. Hopefully, as things begin to open up, the future will seem more hopeful again. 

As that happens, it's important we keep this sub on topic as forum for support, not opinions. This isn't the place to rant that your State/Town/Local cafe is opening up sooner than you'd like, or not soon enough, or that other people aren't acting the way you wish they would. If you're not asking for advice on how to deal with concerns/anxieties around a particular issue, this is the wrong sub - so please, take it elsewhere. 

It's also important, as things open up, that the response to that remains rational. Many of you have been, and still are, very nervous about catching the virus and even of venturing out of the house. One of the most difficult aspects of modding this subreddit has been trying to walk the middle ground between reassuring people enough, but neither playing down the risks nor overemphasising them. The advice I give comes from the guidelines set out by national and international government agencies - the NHS, the UK Government, the CDA and FDA in the US and WHO. I always back up any advice I give with links to reputable sources. 

If people feel they want to take more stringent precautions than these agencies recommend, that's up to you as individuals - but don't insist others must, too. For instance, no agency is recommending that the public need to wear N95 masks (or any mask) in non-crowded outdoor settings. Our policy on mask discussion is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19\_support/comments/frp5na/position\_on\_masks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/frp5na/position_on_masks/) 

I have banned some users in the last week for pushing the idea that much more stringent mask wearing is necessary, and that people who do not adhere to this are putting others at risk, and I will ban others who do the same. I make no apologies for this - the official advice for the public is cloth face coverings in crowded indoor conditions and social distancing at all other times. Posts or comments insisting that more than this is needed are not helpful - they encourage and enable extreme behaviour and make people nervous in settings where they feel the risk is much greater than it actually is (for example, if a mask-less jogger passes them on a country path or a quiet street). If people aren't taking basic precautions in your region, stay away from them. If you post here, post to ask how at risk you actually were, not to rant about how you think their behaviour. was irresponsible. If you do, the post will be removed. 

Please do share your local, national and international good news stories here. If this isn't enough, you can always find some additional ones at [https://covid19goodnews.live/](https://covid19goodnews.live/)

I have been researching but haven't found much on blood clots being a preexisting condition (The CDC mentions lung disease and asthma, but nothing regarding blood clots). Many articles have stated that blood clots have occurred people who have been infected.

For me, it makes sense that with this virus eventually becoming a respiratory infection, someone with less than full health lungs should be very cautious, as I have been.

Am I right to think this? Being confined to a home for so long has not been the best on my mental health, and it does not help when it seems like a lot of people are ""getting back to normal"" when cases are rising.

I am worried about going back to my college because of three things. I am a business major if that helps.

The #1 thing being I could contract Coronavirus and could miss weeks of school, not just days. I am aware that my chances of contracting Coronavirus are rare, and even if I did contract Coronavirus, I probably wouldn't be hospitalized. I have no asthma or underlying conditions that would make it riskier for me to go back to school. Still, if there was a 1% chance you wouldn't survive something, would you want to take that risk? I wouldn't want to risk it. I'm also worried about spreading it to other people that I know, I don't want to get them sick.

2 My college hasn't really given anyone any updates on what in person schooling would be like and what would happen if the college had to close again. I understand that these decisions are not made lightly, but a reassuring email of something like ""we are now discussing ways if how to keep students and staff safe at school,"" would be nice. The only thing they have announced is that they would offer some classes online and some classes in person, but not how they would organize in person classes.

3 I don't have a car to drive to school, and I don't have a license either. Just thinking about driving a car makes me anxious because I'm afraid of getting into a car accident. I was almost hit by a car while trying to cross a street on my bike, and I had the right of way and the walk sign. I don't think that incident makes me afraid to drive a car consciously, but subconsciously? So I take the bus to school and I'm worried about people on the bus not following social guidelines.

Also does anyone else feel like everything is reopening too early?",2020-06-14 07:06:21

I'm still assuming that the vast majority of people who get covid19 will still survive but it's gotten me nervous about this apparent mutation and also it doesn't help that I am scientifically illiterate so I have no idea what to make of this.

I contacted my DR to get a urinary analysis done but by the end of April my body returned back to normal and so far things have stabilized.

Staying with my girlfriend's family for two months, and apparently they aren't taking COVID seriously

In a few weeks, my girlfriend and I will be moving from my parent's house to her parent's house. My family has been extremely safe, both my parents work from home, we never go out unnecessarily, etc. Hers, on the other hand, have not been. Both her parents work retail, they go out like nothing is wrong, and her mom even said that Fauci said we should be going out because if we stay inside our immune systems will deteriorate...

Now, why don't we just stay with my parents? Well, we're in college, and my girlfriend is dependent on some scholarships from their jobs. They've said if we cut them off and/or don't come home in July, they will pull the scholarships. It wouldn't be the end of the world, we would just be in more debt.

Today we are going to establish ground rules with them. We will tell them that these are our demands and that if they do not comply, we will not speak with them again. Note that they are generally kind of abusive and both my girlfriend and I have wanted to cut them off for years, but, again, money.

I'm choosing between my life and my gf's life being in danger and loosing thousands of dollars. Everything will be OK, but I need some support right now. I want to do the right thing, and I don't know what that is.",2020-06-13 19:32:49

Bad coping strategies?,7,h7yqkn,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/h7yqkn/first_post_here_bad_coping_strategies/,5,"I look back to stressful times in my life when I had to meet deadlines or tackle a lot of work in a short amount of time. My fallback strategy used to be keeping my head down and just focusing on what I needed to do with a sort of tunnel vision that would shut a lot of other priorities out. I’d try to eat, sleep, and maintain normal hygiene routines but everything else would get put on the back burner. It was a pretty successful tactic although I’ve become a lot better at managing my time now that I’m not in school and have more control over deadlines and projects in work and life.

But covid doesn’t have a deadline. There isn’t a task list for me to work on or items to check off. The timeline is determined by the virus and the vaccine. Yet I still feel like I want to escape into a hyper focused trance where I feel like I’m getting things done and being productive with the time I have. But there’s nothing to do. Granted, that’s an extremely privileged thing to say. My wife and I are newlyweds (we were married on leap day!) and have been staying at home since mid March. We aren’t too nervous about finances or work although I’m the only one working (from home). I guess I don’t know what I’m asking.

2. Such a strategy would require 100% accuracy. To mess up is to risk somebody's life. I don't know about your circulation department, but we make loads of mistakes when there isn't any life of death pressure.

Our daughter was born right as this whole thing started, like literally as things started shutting down. Her grandparents were only able to hold her for 10 minutes before the hospital kicked them out.

In some ways this was extremely convenient timing, because my wife who works in healthcare was on maternity leave for the last 3 months and I got to essentially extend my paternity leave for 3 months as I continue to work from home. But other things are so much harder. I can't just go buy some extra diapers or wipes. I can't just put the groceries away. My wife can't just come home after work and put the breast milk in the fridge. There's so many extra steps to try and keep everyone safe and healthy. I know that surface transmission is less likely than airborne droplets, but still, that doesn't mean it is completely harmless.

As things have started to get better it's almost more frustrating. New case counts are so much lower, but people are out righteously protesting without masks on and no social distancing. At the same time everyone else just seems to think the pandemic is over and we don't need to be cautious anymore. We've been doing window visits and video chats, but we're getting pressured by my friends and family to hang out in person. I'm just not ready to do that yet, but I think I'm okay with outdoor masked visits at a distance.

My in laws caught COVID and after a rough couple of months are feeling better with successful antibody tests. If they hadn't have caught it, I honestly don't know what we'd be doing for childcare right now. That leads to the real source of my rant which is my parents.

My parents live about 20 minutes away in a small town outside of a major metropolitan area that got absolutely wrecked in March and April by COVID. My mom is just full of emotions. She blames me for missing out on 3 months of my daughter's life. She thinks this whole pandemic was overblown and that we should never have locked down in the first place.

Both of my parents are high risk with being older and obese. My dad is diabetic with managed high blood pressure. My brother lives with them, is diabetic and a smoker. Honestly, if my family caught COVID, I'm the only one not in a statistically high risk category.  However, my mom has very clearly stated that she'd rather hold my daughter and die rather than continue being cautious any longer. (I know that's an extreme scenario, but it's a near verbatim quote)

I'm just at my wit's end. I understand the desire to see her grandchild, and that she's feeling hurt because my in laws are able to spend time with her and she isn't. I just don't feel like she is appreciating how challenging this has been as a new parent, husband, and son. I absolutely want my daughter to spend time with her extended family. It really bums me out that she hasn't been able to. It's not as if this is at all how I envisioned her first year of life to go, and yet I'm being told that I'm somehow punishing my mom for some unknown reason.

I sent her a text message yesterday that just made things worse. I stated very clearly that my first priorities are as a husband and father and then a son, and that I won't apologize for continuing to look out for everyone's wellbeing even if they won't. I told her that I will never use her granddaughter as a weapon to hurt her, but I'm just not happy with how she's been using guilt trips to get her way.

I told myself there would be a vaccine, and this would only be my reality for the next year/year and a half. However, it feels like every second I read some headline and article with more bad news, and I feel it chipping away at me. These articles have even been taking away my hope that we will see a vaccine at all, and I am starting to break down.  Furthermore, I lost my grandma last month and I wasn't able to say goodbye, and I'm feeling so much anger towards the world over it. I simply feel as if the virus is going to keep taking away from my life. I'm in my 20's, this is the time of my life I wanted to date, socialize with my coworkers and friends, travel, and live my life to the fullest. I feel like that's now being taken away from me, and my life is never going to go back to normal.

I understand I could have it so much worse. I am not here saying boo hoo pity me, because  everyone is in the same boat as me, and so, so many people are in much rougher waters. But honestly, I am currently mid mental breakdown and I just need to talk to hear advice from someone. Because the thought of life never being the same, and losing more of my loved ones to this thing, makes me lose all hope.",2020-06-12 08:38:15

For the last few months she started getting progressively weaker. She didn't bark anymore, and couldn't jump on the couches and beds.

Last tuesday her nose started bleeding. It didn't stop with medication and bled for two days. Knowing her history, we were pretty sure it was another tumor. Now she couldn't even walk. Twice she tipped over just trying to pee and hit just layed there sideways cause she couldn't get back up.

The vet said we could treat her but she was in really bad shape and had to go through a lot of testing. Even with treatment she only gave her two months max, and couldn't guarantee she would be healthy during those months. And if the test determined she needed surgery she was so weak she likely wouldn't even wake up from the anesthesia. We decided to put her down.

Having this happen during quarantine is bittersweet. On one hand I'm glad we could all spend her last four months with her pretty much 24/7, but on the other my mental health was already horrible and this is the last thing I needed. 

I still got college classes. Some professors have been understanding and are giving me extra time, but not all of them. I haven't studied or worked on projects AT ALL the last few days and I can already see that coming back to bite me in the ass. It's not even that I'm procrastinating by watching Netflix or playing video games like usual. I just want to sleep.

I was off dating apps for awhile to focus more on myself, and I literally got back on Bumble and Tinder about a week before the pandemic started to shut everything down in the United States. I felt confident, I felt good, and I felt ready to get back out there in the sometimes unforgiving dating world, and just like that the rug was swept under me, and everything just ground to a halt. 

Dating is impossible, and it's been months since I have had any emotionally fulfilling physical contact. I'm sick of doing virtual dates, I'm sick of doing socially distant walks in the park, I'm sick of watching porn and I don't even give a shit about sexting. I want to touch. I want to feel someone's body close to mine. I want to feel their warmth, and their body heat mix with mine. I'm incredibly sexually frustrated and horny, but at this point I'll be happy with simply cuddling while watching a good movie. 

Even the dating profiles have gotten worse since the lockdown. So many profiles say things like ""I'm only on here because I'm bored, entertain me."" I'm not here for anyone's entertainment; I'm there to find an actual relationship, and I feel like I'm expendable, and like I'm some court jester. I want to meet people through my hobbies and meetups in-person, but obviously that's not happening right now. 

For the most part I'm ok with being single and on my own. I have a lot of hobbies and interests that keep me busy like fitness, reading, playing tabletop games (solo games now,) self-teaching myself through online classes, and I'm lucky enough to work, but after being single for awhile I'm ready to get out there, and I'm so tired of this virus putting a stop to it.

Words and thoughts are a mess right now, but I miss her so terribly. I was hoping to come here and just kinda set it out there for any bit of a lift up, and for advice for the upcoming days since my family has two upcoming services. A Rosary mass is today, and a funeral/burial on Friday. I really feel a sense of unease about it though. Being in a small room with 20+ people (along with friends coming in), I worry for my parents, and worry for my family in general.

i just think i've given up. what even is the point of planning ahead for the future when it feels as though everybody and everything i know and love is just gone and maybe never coming back? its only been about 3 months since corona shutdowns started to happen, but it's felt like an eternity. its hard to believe that we're not even close to the finish line, and it's probably gonna get way worse.

i can't even mentally process how bad this is gonna get. i remember thinking that restrictions are only going until april, then to june, then to september, now it feels like even next summer is too optimistic. there was a bright spot of optimism i've had with these protests and direct action, but even that feels like it's fizzled away as of late. i just need to accept that things are going to be really really bad for a really really long time and i should be grateful that i'm still alive and well and will hopefully be so throughout all of this.

i hate talking to my family, my friends, my professors, just anybody. i hate thinking about the future. i hate trying to salvage any optimism throughout all of this. i hate thinking about words and phrases like vaccines, social distancing, second wave, online learning, Fauci, quarantine, covidiot. 

all i can do is just sit in my room, get high, eat junk food, and anxiously scroll through the internet. in another timeline i'd just be done with finals from a quarter i was excited about, preparing to celebrate my birthday, and planning for the summer. honestly, things would've been kinda shitty in their own way too but it was a predictable kind of shittiness. now i feel extremely reluctant to leave my house, and have panic attacks everyday, even though things are starting to reopen in my county and we have a low amount of cases. 

i still feel like i live in a massive state of denial. lately i've been obsessively reading old journals from earlier this year, along with old social media posts, news stories, etc. in some ways i feel as though i inhabit a world of the past. i wake up nearly every morning and for a brief second it seems like the events of the past few months have all been a bad, bad dream. even after when/if we find a vaccine, even after restrictions are lifted, even after the cases and deaths begin to drop, i really do fear that we'll be living with extreme PTSD from this time for the rest of our lives, and that's the scariest to me. time begins to heal our wounds, but COVID-time only rubs more salt into them.

Once I was back up the stairs the final time, I found myself a little out of breath for a minute. Now, I think this is fairly normal for me (awful, I know. I really need to exercise), but of course I worry that this is related to coronavirus.

But  I was sent a 40 page document with all our new 'during the pandemic' operating procedures and honestly as I read through this it was like 'Honestly please tell me is this really worth it, just to reopen physical stores with all this restriction in place' 

The shop I work in is fairly small and gets cramped at the best of times, I personally feel like operating with social distancing guidelines isn't really going to be that practical for work and that it's going to turn off customers we had a massive drop in customers just before the UK went into lockdown. We went from serving say like around 50 customers on an averagely busy week day to struggling to get 10-20 people through the door. 

Like I feel we're only going to get maybe 1 customer in at a time and I can't see people really being that thrilled over it.

I live in Austin. During the SIP we had (Mid-March thru May 1st), things felt good. It was around this time that NYC and other areas were getting pummeled with the overload in severe cases. Now that NYC is on the downswing, I was feeling a lot more relieved as of late. I started hanging out with a small group of people once a week for the month of May, and COVID19 really wasn't a major concern. Things were starting to feel normal again. I returned to the office.

But now, at least in Travis county, we are seeing an uptick in positive cases. And I'm slightly concerned. Sure, this means that more people are getting tested, but the prevalence of the virus can also be immediately confirmed by this uptick as well. There's no denying that.

Americans in this part of the country have just been so nonchalant about COVID19. I get it, we never saw the severity like NY state did. But I have a bad feeling we're gonna see an actual 1st wave in these places like Houston, Austin, and Arizona that were spared between March-May. Is this how it's gonna be for the next 12-18 months? A few weeks, maybe a month of relief, then a bad surge, and repeat. 

What happens to all of the counties (counties that are of a larger population, I mean) that have done really well when they inevitably open up? Are flights going to be restricted? Is interstate travel going to be restricted? We sure as hell know that won't happen in the US. Ya, do a ""14 day quarantine"", but have no actual method of confirming that people follow these orders.

I've been coming into the office everyday now. They require masks to be worn all day and they screen us for temperatures when we walk into the building. At first, this made me feel like I had a strong sense of security and I could go back to the office worry-free. My coworker that I worked closely with stayed home sick for the past 2 days. I was like, sure, I did see her last week, whatever, we were both wearing masks the last time we interacted befores she developed symptoms so I should be fine. The average time span between infection and symptom onset is 5 days, or so I've read.

She came into the office today. I point blank asked her if she was feeling better and she said, no not really. WTF? What are you doing here, I thought to myself?? Again, she was soo nonchalant about it. Did the temperature screening not work or? Or are all these ""measures"" my company is taking just for optics and not actually keeping me safe?

However..we just had a death in the family (not covid related) and need to fly out the state for the burial, because the deceased had wished to be buried in a certain place & we want to honor those wishes... but in all honesty we are beyond paranoid to go to the airport and take the 3 hour flight. We thought about possibly leaving the deceased preserved until covid gets better so we can hold a full funeral service and proper burial but at this point with covid getting worse who knows until when this will go on....

A little over a week ago, I started having a very slight cough and sore throat. By slight, I’d say that I was coughing maybe one time every hour or so, sometimes more sometimes less, but I was clearing my throat a lot. My sore throat felt more like allergies and would present itself more in the morning and then go away as the day progressed. That has since gotten better, except I do feel a little bit of a sore throat in the morning but I think that is just allergies/dryness since it goes away after drinking water. Of course I was nervous with those symptoms, but they were the only symptoms I had so I had been assuming they are allergy related.

The last few days, though, I’ve developed a sinus headache, that feels like a lot of pressure on my sinuses in my forehead, occasionally painful. I mainly feel specific sinus pain when I am looking up or shaking my head a lot, but there definitely is also an overall consistent pressure feeling (not pain) without moving my eyes or head. It hasn’t been bad enough to take anything for it, but it feels like it could be getting a bit worse. I have had no nasal congestion though, just the sinus pressure. 

I have not had any other symptoms of Covid-19 at all, no fever, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, body aches, nothing. Because of this, even if I wanted to get tested, my county won’t test me since my symptoms are very mild and I don’t have a fever. It has been a week and a half since these symptoms started, and I still have not developed a fever or anything too terrible so I feel like even if I do have it, this will likely be the extent of it, but my biggest concern is for my high risk husband. Either way, it would probably be too late and he would already have caught it since I’ve been having symptoms for so long. He has not developed any sort of symptoms at all since the onset of my symptoms, though. 

Does this sound like it could be Covid-19? I have major anxiety over all of this. I have been extremely careful and I’ve been working from home, so I really haven’t gone out at all minus for groceries almost 3 weeks ago, where everyone had to wear a mask, I went early in the morning so there were not very many people there. My husband has had to go in to work a couple of days each week, but he always wears his mask, as do his coworkers, and he’s very cautious to not touch his face and keep his hands washed. The only thing that could be debatable is his definition of 6 feet apart (his 6 feet is more like 3-4 feet) but he swears he is keeping more than 6 feet at work.

The podcast centers on the ways in which our minds lead us astray in our search for happiness, and the methods we can use to correct it. Since the pandemic has led to massive changes in our personal circumstances, and many people are feeling negative effects on their mental health, there is a coronavirus bonus season. This season focuses both on why the pandemic affects us in the way it does, and how we can mitigate it. Not all advice will be applicable to everyone, but there's probably something in there for everyone.

The rest of the podcast is worth listening to as well, as some of the ideas mentioned in the regular episodes help explain why the pandemic affects us in this way. Personally, ep. 1x4 explains why working from home affects me so negatively, and why now that I can go into the office part time again I feel much better.

Then little things pile up and cause me to easily become irritable and snap. My ""lovely"" windows 10 pc for example...all the updates and crap, and then the chrome browser...then I try to keep neat track of all my usernames and passwords which I try to keep somewhat complex but simple enough for ME to remember...but then you, reddit...you decide to pull some nonsense and randomly NOT accept my password, after i KNOW I've entered it correctly several times in a row...both username and password are correct, you have my email and everything...so then I need to mess around with that!

How can something so dumb and small like that cause me to practically snap?!!! Maybe this is what I get for trying out a form of social platform after years of avoiding these things for the most part, even keeping it low activity, and then it is glitchy as all hell, especially at a time when we need things to friggin WORK! Yup...these ridiculous things just make me snap, and then I break down into a sobbing mess. My mental state is breaking down. I do take my meds and talk to my therapist about my returned passive suicidal thoughts while I struggle with this isolation. The fact that Seattle did not move up to phase 2 and is instead at phase 1.5 was a recent blow...nice.

A close friend who I am also physically intimate with, one of a few people I trust in my life right now, I probably won't be able to see him for several more months, because while he is well and good right now, he has to be strict with his own personal quarantine, due to his body being immunocompromissed. I wish I generally understood more about that, because I keep meeting more people like that and would like to understand better. How does someone find out they are that way? Is there a test? Do people just guess with a doctors help? Is there any way at all that people can help to boost their immune system if they are born like that? Cause that totally sucks, especially if there is little one can do to help their immune system...or maybe there isn't a way right now but there will be later.

I guess I am lucky and take for granted that I have always had a really healthy and ""normal"" physical immune system. It's my mental health that has always been at stake. Chronic depression and anxiety in my family, insomnia, ptsd, and common appearance issues that many women in American struggle with on top of all that...some trauma from a dysfunctional childhood and family. The baggage sucks. I am glad to be working on things  with my therapist though, even if it IS unfortunately by phone. I much prefer in person, I feel like I get more out of it that way.

Wait...anyway...back to whatever I wanted to rant about. My friend and ""lover"", I am sad to come to a realization that we won't get to physically see each-other for much longer than I originally thought...probably several months. Especially if this damn city (Seattle) is going to go at a snails pace up to phase 1.75 or some such nonsense instead of phase 2...or got forbid, if we phase backwards! I should have probably avoided reading some things on reddit and the news that this nasty little virus could stick around stubbornly for years, even if a vaccine became widely available, that isn't a guarantee. I was doing my best to get some of my personal baggage and other awful stuff together this year...things I was slowly working towards and looking forward to...then this bullsh\*t hits. Then other awful things in my personal life follow, and then some chaos keeps happening in the world...

I want to give up. I want to scream. I want to cry and scream and just disappear. I feel so isolated and oppressed and I am very scared..and I have been questioning my sanity more and more these days. I miss being held and comforted, I miss him, I miss my other friends. I miss the lack of fear and uncertainty...I miss working towards building up my life and having a purpose. I feel completely worthless and like I have no purpose at all. I need people...I need my people. Phone calls and computer screens aren't enough...they feel shallow and empty and hollow.

I am only looking for empathetic understanding and validation. I don't want any fear-mongering like doomsday stuff...I need to really stop reading the news and some other posts. I'm sorry that I myself wrote a bit of pessimistic doomsday sounding stuff. I am looking forward to my therapy on Thursday. I will try to go and take care of myself after this. I am safe and I have phone numbers in case I need to talk to somebody, in case anybody reads this and becomes concerned. I don't always respond to other posts so...yeah.

I know that I am not alone, I've seen other people ""screaming"" inside through their posts who are also struggling badly with this awful pandemic isolation. No...this is not fun. This is not at all fun.

Thanks for reading. Later.",2020-06-11 09:31:43

462,False Negatives Experience -- Strange Scenario,3,h0qqj2,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/h0qqj2/false_negatives_experience_strange_scenario/,5,"Hey all,

I'm posting regarding my mother and was curious if this is something any of you have experienced and/or heard of. I've done my own research and know false negatives are possible (up to 20% chance even during optimal testing time), but this just seems strange to me.

My mom is 68 and has a few health issues, but under control. Good health overall. She's a caretaker part-time for a 93 year old lady. It turns out that the elderly lady she cares for, plus 5 people she was in contact with (other caretakers/the woman's children), tested positive for COVID-19. My mom was directly in contact with the woman she takes care of for three nights.

So, my mom went the day she started running a low grade fever to get tested. It comes back negative. Feel like she tested too early. She has symptoms at this point -- fever of about 99.2-99.5 for 5 days now, really tired, body aches (her feet really hurt the first few days), sore throat, coughed only one day a few times, nausea, sinus issues. She got tested again yesterday (about 4 days after symptoms started), and it came back negative AGAIN.

This is just mind blowing to me. She has symptoms and everyone else around her has tested positive. What are your thoughts on this? The nurse told her at this point just to quarantine for 7 more days. I'm  beginning to think there's something wrong with the accuracy of these tests, and if that's the case, how many people were told they were negative and went on to spread this stuff? It's crazy to me.

Any insights or thoughts are welcome. Thanks! :)

Around February, I also started talking to someone online in another country, who is my dream girl, who is 29.

However, being stuck in lockdown (in the US) since March has taken a massive toll on my mental health. Suddenly, all my hopes and expectations were destroyed, and I feel like me (as well as her), we're going to spend the rest of our 20s locked up, and it's causing daily anxiety and depression. I realize how short life is, and I'm starting to question why I spent so many years working, being responsible, saving money rather than traveling, and earning money, instead of spending time with SO, friends, family.

People keep saying, oh, I'll resume xyz when ""corona ends"", as if it's a temporary thing. People seem to be in denial of the fact that there's no reason this wouldn't last 2, 3, 5+ years. Sure, lockdowns will loosen then start up again when waves hit again. But things won't go back to the same for years. To me, this seems to be the new world order.


Edit: all, there's a power outage that has also knocked out cell towers so I won't be replying to comments for a few hours or days. I'm at a grocery store in another town using WiFi to write this.",2020-06-10 16:50:47
464,Obese worrier with a symptomatic spouse who got some encouraging words from an ER doc - thought I'd share.,218,gzxlxa,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gzxlxa/obese_worrier_with_a_symptomatic_spouse_who_got/,51,"I remember in March going to the CDC website to learn about this thing and my heart dropping when I read that people with a BMI of 40+ are at high risk.  I had been thinking just the old were at risk and here I am at the age of 31 feeling incredibly vulnerable because I had let my weight out of control and up to a BMI of 47. 


In the following months I've had extremely high anxiety. Everyday I google ""obesity+COVID"" to try and figure out what the science is saying, I dig for local news stories to find young people who have passed away to try and distinguish myself from them, I skim reddit to try and find stories from overweight people who have recovered.  None of these things are helpful and I don't condone any of them.  


What I do recommend is walking. - I started walking daily, committed myself to getting my 10,000 steps in and pushed for more.  Started eating healthy and doing some intermittent fasting.  I lost 30 lbs in about 2 months - I was ecstatic just Monday I stepped on the scale and realized I was 20 lbs away from being under 40 BMI.

And then My wife started displaying symptoms, and one of her coworkers tested positive.  I felt hopeless - dismayed I couldn't get to under a 40 BMI before the virus came calling, feeling like I'm in for a death sentence if I catch it from my Wife.  I reached out to my best friend who is an ER doc in Chicago and he said the following about being obese:

**""And this is just speculation, but I think there is probably a difference between someone at your weight who is gaining weight and someone who is losing weight. Obesity is a risk factor (we think) in part due to its inflammatory nature, but the physiology of someone losing weight is likely different and I would think they would have a better outcome.""**

He didn't give me platitudes, or make assurances that I would have known were white lies.  He told me that what I have already done will likely help.  He motivated me to keep trying to change my physiology.

So if you are like me, obese and obsessing over this online, just try and go for a walk.  You may not be able to lose all the weight - but you can start changing your physiology *today*.",2020-06-10 02:14:38

I don't know if it's safe for my family to be there.,67,gzrmaf,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gzrmaf/my_sister_is_planning_a_large_wedding_in/,27,"My sister is having a large, 250 person wedding in Wisconsin in September. I live in another state in the midwest. I am supposed to be standing at the wedding, as is my wife, and my 4-year-old son is supposed to be the ringbearer. I asked what she was planning for the wedding, and she said that the venue isn't requiring any restrictions, the waiters will wear masks and guests can if they'd like but don't need to, and they are very excited to have their wedding.

There are quite a few older people invited, my parents included, and I told her I don't think it's safe yet. I said that I'd go as I don't want to miss her wedding, but I didn't think my wife or son would be able to attend. I also said I probably wouldn't stay for the reception.

I wanted to tell her now so she could plan around this -- not having a ring bearer and one of your bridesmaids is pretty big, and she should know sooner than later. She said, ""if you want to burn those bridges, that's your decision."" The conversation got heated, and I said that a lot of people would probably choose not to come. She said sure, but those people weren't her brother (again, I said I'm going, but not my wife or son). I just want her to understand that the danger isn't over yet, and I want to be safe for my family and do my part of the social contract around COVID.

My parents (divorced) are on either side. My mom is going along with it, and trying to have it both ways, but I can't tell if she thinks there really is a danger here or if I'm overreacting. My dad thinks that it's ridiculous that she won't listen to reason, but she's an adult and will make her own decisions. My mom has told me my sister didn't want to have masks at all but is allowing my mom to buy and supply masks for the event. There aren't to be any masks in the pre-event pictures, however.

Am I being overly dramatic? I know it's three months away -- her response is ""I can't believe you're making this decision for something that's still 3 months away"". I'm open to amending my plans if I hear there's something to do to mitigate danger (social distancing in the event venue, limited invitees, etc, moving the event outside). But it sounds like she's not really making any changes to her plans, and I'm really frustrated that she's acting like nothing is different. She said to me, ""Do you really expect everyone to just quarantine for the next 5 years until they have a vaccine?""

I don't know. Am I being unreasonable? Should I have waited to say something? It doesn't sound like anyone else is saying anything, so I felt like I needed to say something, but maybe I shouldn't have.",2020-06-09 21:24:24
466,Feeling depressed and trapped,12,h024y6,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/h024y6/feeling_depressed_and_trapped/,2,"My life before the lockdowns hadn't been going well. No real friends, alone all the time, last ""relationship"" was years ago. I'm doing OK in college (A student) but it doesn't make me happy, it's stressful to maintain that performance. But before I could go out, meet people and hope to improve my situation, now I can't.

I moved back with my mother last year, she's 68 and does have a lot of health problems (diabetes, HBP, cholesterol, previous stroke). She's still a ""young elderly"" person, not frail, but a she has lot more conditions than people her age usually have.

Because I live with her, I haven't gone out at all in the past 2 months and a half. I get things delivered, clean/throw out the packaging. I haven't even gone out on walks because people don't respect social distancing. They crowd you and don't wear masks, and I hate having to monitor them constantly and move out of the way.

It's tradition in my province for people to move out on July 1st. Most leases end on that date. I was thinking maybe of moving out earlier than expected, finding a cheap lease somewhere else, but it makes me uncomfortable because that's not what I was planning financially. I couldn't find a summer job and my savings aren't very good, it would be very tight. I also feel ambivalent about it because I go from socializing with 1 person and a cat, to socializing with basically no one. But the idea is that if I live alone again, I could go out without fear since I'm not worried about me. But I guess that ship has sailed, it's June 9th and I couldn't bring myself to visit any apartments or make a call. There are still leases the remainder of the year, it's not impossible to change my mind, but there are a lot less.

Things are slowly reopening. My mother wants us to go buy flowers, go on the terrace of a restaurant, and other things, with PPE of course. I feel like I always take the ""sensible"" decisions even if it means sacrifising my own happiness. In between taking a risk of hospitalization or death for her vs. flowers or food at a restaurant, it seems dumb to take the risk. But at the same time, there's no end in the horizon to this pandemic.

I always feel like people can't imagine it, but my parents were/are dysfunctional. My father abandoned me and my mother never took care of me when I was a child, I have a lot of trauma. It probably looks like an unfair comparison to people that have a good relationshop with their parents, but it feels to me like my mother is once again in the role of the vampire, taking away from me and not giving anything in return. But it's not in her control this time, it's the pandemic. I feel responsible because I didn't deal with the trauma of my childhood well and it's taken me longer to be financially independant, yet she's giving me cheap board right now. That relationship is full of painful and ambivalent feelings. 

In Canada we only get 4 months of good weather (May - August). Soon that will over, all I have look forward to is things becoming even worse as fall rolls in and my free time is replaced with headache to get more As again (in online classes this time). I don't think I would do it, but I feel a little suicidal again. I can't socialize, I have no venue of making my life better or more meaningful. I'm trapped in an already bad life, this situation has taken my hope and my outs away from me.",2020-06-10 06:38:49
467,Possible exposure,5,h03q5r,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/h03q5r/possible_exposure/,6,"I could use some encouragement or advice. I have a possible exposure situation. For background, I live and work in a national park area so it is very isolated from civilization and services. People run into car trouble all the time out here and my co-workers and I regularly help or give advice. I have given desperate people rides before, though I am discerning in who I feel safe picking up. Today, driving home inside the park, I saw a woman and a little boy waving for help in the road. I pulled over because at least I know the area and could possibly help them or give them options. She really wanted a ride to a hotel, the car was crashed and undrivable, and she had a domestic violence situation with her husband. She swore that the car wasn't stolen but he would be very angry if he knew she had damaged it, which would happen if I called a tow company or any authorities. She was afraid he would hurt her or her son. So I, thinking like I would during normal times, said, ""Yes, I can give you a ride."" I didn't have any more masks (I had some with me earlier but they were disposable and I had thrown out the last one after I used it as I wasn't expecting to interact with anyone else that day). They didn't have on masks. I didn't feel like I could say no because I had no real excuse to not help them, and maybe because I'm a pushover. So I drove them for a little over an hour to the nearest hotel. When someone is riding with you, talking about how scared she is from the car crash (they weren't seriously injured, luckily) and her awful husband there doesn't really seem to be a good time to ask, ""Have you guys been isolating?"" Also they coughed some, but she smelled heavily of cigarettes, and they said the airbags went off and were full of dust that got right in their faces. So I feel like I did a good person thing but a possibly bad health thing. I know I probably should have done something else but I can't go back in time and change it now - so I don't really need to hear about that. So I'm going to spend probably the next two weeks very anxious. Does anyone know after a possible exposure how long you should wait to get a test? The internet has conflicting advice. And anything you can say to help calm me down would also be appreciated. 

Edited to fix voice typing issues and to add: I'm 33F, with some health issues that may or may not matter (EDS/POTs, sleep apnea, anxiety disorder, just slightly overweight). This happened in an area that has a high number of known cases.",2020-06-10 08:28:39

My state is prematurely reopening, which means there will be a spike in cases, but we can't do anything to stop that. He works from home and I work in health care. I've given up on social distancing since literally no one did it to begin with here. It was quite literally a losing battle. 

Some things I should note; I sanitize so much my skin is peeling off and I always wear a mask when I go out. The only time I remove my mask is if I need to adjust it (home made) because it's hurting my ears so badly I can barely talk without my eyes watering. 

Well, my car decided to take a dump on me recently. It's junk and I need to get rid of it or end up carless. So, unfortunately I also live in bum-squat nowhere. The nearest trustworthy car place is in a city not too far from me. I had my boyfriend come with me because, let's be real, these places will haggle harder with me than him. The city had done a decent job of containing and subduing the spread of Covid, so I felt safe outside, in my mask, or indoors in my mask and using hand sanitizer. 

I did find some cars that are affordable and nice, so I was happy about that. I went to work like normal and am so happy with my job. But today, I took a nap and woke up with drainage and a sore throat... I also learned that they're labeling the city I went to as a hot spot again... Wtf??!!! Seriously???!!!!

Now I'm scared as fuck and I don't want to miss time so early in this new career I fought with every fiber of my being to get... 

I get drainage from time to time. I also cough and sneeze sometimes and get a random headache or two. I never used to worry. But now because literally anything could be the damn virus, I panic. I've been on hold with a minute clinic for about 21 minutes, now, waiting to see how soon I can get a test. 

I don't have a fever, I feel fine, no fatigue, no shortness of breath or wheezing, no chest congestion, no runny nose, no new cough or persistent cough, etc. 

I've never had a lot, if I'm being honest. I just want to hold on to these little things that I really enjoy. I love my job. I spent a lot of time unhappy and miserable in old jobs. I finally have something great. I'd like to keep it. 

My area hasn't been hit hard compared to places like NY or LA. We're very lucky. I just hope I can be lucky too. I hope it's allergies and not Covid. 

Peace and love to you all. Keeps safe and see your doctor if you need to!!! Take care of yourself!!!

::EDIT::

My sore throat cleared up with no other symptoms. I never ran a fever, never felt sick, and I am now very relieved. This all leads to allergies. My coworkers seem to think it was my AC that dried out my sinuses and stirred up allergens and caused the whole ordeal. It obviously wasn't Covid and I am so glad. 

I'm going to celebrate by going to a secluded spot on the lake today and having a dip. Don't worry, I will be far away from others and only with my boyfriend. After a long work week and lots of hard work on both our parts, I feel like we've earned a little outdoors fun.

Mostly just venting",7,gzy5sp,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gzy5sp/returning_to_work_soon_extreme_anxiety_mostly/,7,"Hello everyone, hope things are well. This mag be quite a hefty post, for I have quite a bit on my mind. I will do my best to provide a TLDR

A little background on myself:
25 female Michigan 
Wayne county to be specific. 
I live with elderly grandparents and and uncle.. While my w are generally healthy, they do have health concerns, especially if compromised by the virus. My grandfather (70) is a heart patient, and also had a stroke and triple bypass surgery and mitral valve replacement. He's in generally good health. He's a badass ☺️
My grandmother(76) who used to be a smoker has early stages of copd (however she does not smoke anymore. Hi five gram) is a two time breast cancer survivor (double high five gram) and recently in December when having her gallbladder removed, discovered she was afib. She had a cardio version done and she's doing well 🙏🏻 she's also a badass. 

My uncle(53)….oh boy. We've always butted heads so there's history here. But we tend to tolerate each other, but lately  tensions are obviously high. I fear he is not taking the most necessary precautions when it comes to his parents. He claims he wears a mask and what not, but he's gone and stayed at other people's homes whom we don't know, sometimes not even telling us when he's coming home or not. I understand that he's  an adult and he can make his own choices. However he lives in his at risk parents house so his choices aren't just affecting him right now.. It just really saddens me to see him have such little regard for his them..I have past reasons and instances not to trust him. Me and my grandparents are concerned about this, with good reason. Whenever we try to talk to him
About it he thinks we are “demeaning him,” “we never want to see him do well in life “ I could go ON AND ON about this man. We've had this talk with him three times now and sadly my grandparents just will not take the action to get him out of their house. He's made it clear he will make it as hard as possible for them which…obviously they are already scared and stressed enough as it is. He's a very manipulative human and this is a big part of the reason I moved in, so my grandparents wouldn't get taken advantage of anymore. Welp. I feel like I failed there lol. Okay..y'all get the point on this one. It's just an ongoing battle that we're all exhausted with and lately I've just wanted to focus on making this time less stressful for them. (Any tips are greatly appreciated. ) I've done all the cleaning I can grandparents are washing and doing everything they can. The last talk we had with him ended with if you're not going to respect our wishes then he needs to get out. So far he seems to have chilled a bit, but My anxiety makes feel as if the damage is already done.  i just pray and pray and pray he's not bringing something home. I can't let myself think about if he does. …. Or if I do, from the grocery store or something?! With restrictions being lifted and what not I'm still reluctant to even see friends.. I have had the worst anxiety of my life , which I'm sure a lot of others have as well. It's such a scary and confusing time. 

I work as a teachers assistant at a private Montessori preschool/elementary  that also operates as a summer camp. I have been out of work since March 13 but just got the word we will be reopening June 15. Tons of emotions I feel. Scared. Excited!!! I miss those babies so so much! Confused. Oh. And anxious and impending  dread. I have thought of every single possible worst case scenario. Terrified of bringing something home even though they're taking every precaution in the book..And then there's all the new guidelines like y'all. Holy shit. I also worry about how different and hard it will be for the kids and it makes me feel selfish for worrying about having to follow new guidelines, as if Their whole little worlds aren't  being flipped upside down.  It's definitely going to be a trying time. I don't want my anxiety to hold me back forever. I can't be scared forever and I recognize this but my brain does not at the moment. If that makes sense. 

I don't know if I'm being irrationally scared or what. But it's consuming my life. I have a work meeting on Wednesday and I also  have a doctors appointment the following day to talk about anxiety and work. I hope that by then I can have some more clarity on the situation. Assess the risks at work, ask the doctor if it's too much of a risk?? Am I just being paranoid???? I know that the cases are going down. My best best friend works at a local hospital (miss her so much honestly I want to cry rn lol) and she gives me little updates everyday. So I know there's positivity out there, it just can be really hard to focus on it. For awhile I was doing well, staying off the news which at times just causes me to think very negatively.. I think what is setting me off and what it boils down to, is going back to work and the what if's about my uncle. At the end of the day If my work wasnt taking every single precaution I would leave. However it definitely seems like they are. I've spoken to my boss briefly and she says she understands my concerns and is confident I will have more clarity Wednesday. 

Sorry if this is so scattered and all over the place. Welcome to my brain 😅. I'm not sure why I'm writing this. To vent?! For advice? Opinions? Heck idk I'll be lucky if anyone even takes the time to read the entire thing. If anything, it felt better to write my thoughts out. 

TLDR:
25 f living with elderly grandparents (71m and 76f) and uncle (53). They all are in generally good health but do have predicting conditions. (heart patients, copd, stroke, cancer. No covid please these people have dealt with enough!) feel as if uncle is not taking necessary precautions, and putting huge strain on family and me.. I was called back to work at the school I work at. It's also a summer camp. and am terrified. Work is taking all the precautions in the book, but anxiety really is a bitch! While I've been diligent with cleaning and everything at home I feel helpless and scared also just..unsure if I'm being irrationally scared.  Mainly just venting. Thanks to anyone who does read.

I am putting this question out there because I want to understand the mindset of people who seem to behave as if there wasn't a world-wide and potentially deadly pandemic out there.

**Please do NOT reply with any anger or hate or judgement!**

Please keep it a polite and emotionally detached discussion for research purposes.

**Anything with psychological background is preferred.**

**TLDR:**

I see reports of people flooding beaches and bars. And I see the number of COVID-19 cases continue to rise (in part as a result of gatherings).

I understand why some states feel pressured to re-open (mostly economic reasons, I hope).

What I don't understand is why people would insist on performing non-essential group activities that are very clearly dangerous during a pandemic.

I also want to understand why people who are ""young and strong and likely to be fine if infected"" do not think one step further about how it's not just about them but also about their families (especially the elderly) and co-workers who can be infected by them.

I'd like to see some psychological ideas that might help me explain this.

Again, no flaming - I seriously want to understand this.

**More background in case you're interested:**

Already in early March, my wife and I looked at the facts and decided to hunker down. We took one last shopping trip (nothing too excessive since we didn't want to take from others) mid-March, and that was it. We rarely leave the house, and we feel quite confident that we will not get infected or infect others (we would not want that on our conscience).

But then last month, a band I know announced that they might consider playing in the outside courtyard of a retirement community (the most vulnerable and most effected community type), and they asked if I wanted to play with them. I very strongly declined and gave my reasons. Personally, I don't think anything of this sort will be safe until maybe next year if we're lucky.

And today I received a notification that two music venues in my area are opening up again - this involves multiple people on stage, spectators, and even dancers. I cannot see how they could possibly have any kind of social distancing, and I am not certain the venues will enforce any capacity limits (in many cases, opening under capacity is not financially worth the effort).

I am having a hard time with all of this. It shakes my confidence in my own judgement. I have a bit of a background in science and biology, and the facts I continue to research make sense to me (even as some of the facts change which is normal in science).

Because of that, staying home also makes sense to me. But seeing so many people that appear to be disregarding all the facts and warnings is confusing and alarming to me. It makes me wonder if I am completely wrong and if all the facts are wrong. My brain is having trouble believing in myself when there is my word against that of thousands of people.

So I am trying to understand what drives people to do this.

Please discuss politely.

Thank you!",2020-06-09 22:37:19
474,Really worried about my father's anxiety levels - what is too safe and what is not safe enough?,9,gzsymu,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gzsymu/really_worried_about_my_fathers_anxiety_levels/,2,"My dad is in his 60s, suffers from severe adult asthma, anxiety, depression, and is now very afraid of COVID-19... rightfully so.

My mother is in her 60s and has factors involved that may consider her to be immunocompromised. Unlike my father, she isn't very responsible and doesn't care that much. She isn't very self-aware when it comes to her personal risk.

I'm in my 20s, healthy, young, fit, and have gotten caught up in their household due to circumstances that are an entirely different story of their own (newly married, live overseas, got caught up in the visa process when lockdowns happened - visa processing paused - haven't seen my husband in six months... etc.)

So ever since my dad began working from home in March we have been a totally sterile household. We did this to preserve my parents' health, and also because I was due to return to my husband and wanted to be 'clear' to go if the circumstances changed. We've stayed home, ordered our groceries, haven't seen friends, sterilized packages, the whole 9 yards since then. It has been hard.

If I had known that I was going to be in my home country for longer than the 2 months that it was initially going to take to process my visa, I would have gotten an apartment, but I had no idea that I would be here for this long, and I have no idea how much longer I will have to stay here... so I have no other choice but to stay in my parent's home.

I have to consider myself as a vector in every single thing that I do. I'm much more aware of this than my mother is, who constantly tries to push boundaries and wonders why she can't just see her friends - and doesn't understand how her own persistent cough and inability to control it would mean forcibly exposing the whole family to this illness if she were to pick it up. So, with these things in mind - I won't even do socially distant things with friends, as I know they've been out protesting lately.. because they may have encountered something, because numbers are rising anyway due to reopenings, and so on. I don't want to take the risk, for my parents' sake.

My dad is living in such fear. He is responsible for sterilizing all of our groceries, packagings, everything because the only way he'll know that it's being done right is if he is the one to do it. He has set up a whole UV chamber in the garage where he places envelopes and unpackaged items to decontaminate for a whole day after they are unboxed (I was initially fine with waiting 3 days to open a package and then just washing my hands after). He's looking into getting custom fit masks for all of us - I was a fashion design student and can literally pattern something to fit each one of us perfectly, but he wants to use this company because they can scan your face with an APP and add filters to the masks - which is not even the purpose of a mask - they're just barriers, not respirators.

The other day was my birthday and one of my friends wanted to come to spend the day outdoors with me, I wound up telling her she couldn't come because it was stressing my dad out so much - just one slip up and we're all done.

But that's the thing... just one slip up could completely undermine his efforts to avoid this, and he may not become severely ill... but what if he did? At my or my mother's own hands?

It's just so difficult because if I wasn't with my parents, I would probably be a lot less careful - but I'm doing everything that I can to keep them safe, and to ultimately lower my dad's stress.

I'm almost more worried about the stress killing him at this point, or the anxiety making the illness worse for him if he does catch it. The other day my mom wanted to just go for a drive with him and he gave her a whole health lecture before they could even get into the car. They drove to our summer home just to walk on the beach for the day and along the way encountered one of our relatives who had also stopped into the house to have lunch. This basically ruined not only the day, but the entire next two weeks for my dad who was fretting that the encounter may have potentially given them COVID.

I just don't know what to think anymore. I don't know anyone who is being as careful as we are, but I can't say that what my dad is doing is wrong either. I wouldn't want him to wind up getting really ill, or even dying from it.

I wish that I could leave so that I no longer carry the responsibility of protecting my parents. I have friends who want me to move in with them in New York until I can go back to my husband in the UK but if I were to go to them.... I couldn't go back to my parents without quarantining away from them somewhere for two weeks prior (and I wouldn't be able to bring all of the stuff that I need to take back with me to the UK to NYC).

Is anyone else here being this cautious? Is this really just how we should live if we don't want to get sick for the next year? 

I just feel so sad for my dad. I don't want him to be this scared. I don't want to undermine all of his efforts by making one careless mistake. I don't want anything bad to happen to him. I don't want to add to his stress.",2020-06-09 22:31:04

Now essentially I need to find a new career path over the issue which is something I'm really upset by.

I've always considered myself to be a fairly intelligent and well-reasoned person. I follow both the politics and world news pretty regularly and have always thought I'd done so in a dispassionate way without letting ideology guide my views and opinions.

When Covid hit I was sent out of the office to work from home on March 10 (where I remain). I read plenty of news from all different sources and I could see that even though I wasn't in an epicenter that this was still a pretty serious situation (I'm in Boston for the record and while it hasn't been NYC levels, we've certainly had our share). 

I didn't - and still haven't - adjusted well to working from home, but as I read and ingested plenty of news, facts, and commentary it was pretty easy for me accept what was going on and why we were taking the precautions we were. When crazy Uncle Jimmy posted the Plandemic video on Facebook it was pretty easy to cut through the bullshit. When nutty Aunt Alice posted about how nobody could tell her to wear a mask because FREEDOM it was pretty easy to say ""Hey, wait a minute. We're doing this because...""

Like I said though, I've always felt myself a level-headed, dispassionate, and objective person. I did not share these opinions, I considered them wrong, but I could kind of sympathize with why someone would buy into them. I didn't have the energy to argue with them but I had no problem stating my own opinion, backing it with facts, and saying ""agree to disagree"".

Fast-forward a few more weeks and I'm afraid I'm getting beyond the point of merely understanding why someone might want to buy into a counter-factual narrative. I can still call BS when something is obviously BS, but I'm starting to find myself reading a little less critically. I catch myself cherry-picking facts to support the narrative I wish were true rather than the one my intellect tells me is true. I'm not articulating anything, spoken or otherwise, at this point but I'm starting to feel myself rolling my eyes and discounting things that I normally wouldn't. When my immuno-compromised wife says that ""looks like restaurants are opening next week, but I think we're going to wait a bit before heading back out"" I can feel a myself giving a mental eye-roll and thinking ""come on, everything's fine"".

The short of it all is that I seem to have lost the mental strength to look at the situation objectively and am instead starting to try and fit things into the narrative I want to see rather than the one that exists. Mostly it's internal, I'm not sharing wacky conspiracy stuff on Facebook and I'm not refusing to wear a mask into the grocery store...but that's today. I'm not sure where I'll be two weeks from now.

I'm hoping this is just Covid fatigue and I'll get over it, but I really feel as if I'm losing my ability to think critically about this situation and instead of cutting through the bullshit I'm starting to let it in and before long I'll be believing it. Whatever it is, I don't like the change I'm seeing in myself.",2020-06-08 19:53:05

It also doesn't help that I work weekdays and the girlfriend has been scheduled more weekends as of late.   


Anyways I actually went out to see a friend for the first time since the pandemic. I don't even think he knows how much seeing him meant a big deal to me. I haven't really told anyone else outside of reddit that I have been more depressed lately because of this. So when I was able to see him when we went out to play Pokemon Go to do some new raids that came out it felt awesome. It was like a huge part of my depression calmed down some just from seeing him and doing something I used to love doing all the time before the pandemic.  


We were able to socially distant ourselves without really making any changes to how we did things. If you aren't aware in Pokemon Go there are these things called Raid Battles and you need more players within the game to take it out. You can either go out and walk to these locations to participate in the battle or you can reach some of the locations in your car. So me and him drove around to do the raid battles and was able to chat while being in our own cars the whole time.  


It was really an awesome time and it really helped my mental state being able to go out and do something that I love. Plus I just think being able to socialize with one of my close friends felt so amazing.

481,I need some tips to keep chatting online with my friends and co-workers online...quarantine is getting me nervous,13,gyvxz8,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gyvxz8/i_need_some_tips_to_keep_chatting_online_with_my/,2,"I thought the quarantine period would last around 2 weeks, when my country first found out its first case of COVID-19, but then, time passed and now we are close to complete 3 months locked in home. 😅😅 I don´t seem very affected with that…in my house we have plenty of video games, books and other activities to stay entertained and healthy (like doing virtual volunteering, watching YouTube, and exercising my abs and arms) ...

My mayor challenge, however, is to keep the contact with my friends and teammates during quarantine. I have this constant fear that if I chat too much or too little, they will reject me (just as a close friend at college ghosted me when she failed to comfort me during a sad time. She rejected me later saying that I was too intense interacting with her though social media...when we live far away from each other...but that is another story for another day 😂). I have to deal with this sometimes in my online classes, and at my volunteering group. My volunteering group doesn´t seems to stop working, even during these trying times. I often stop looking at my WhatsApp and wait until it is necessary to reply...except in the case when I´m attending my father (who lives in other province) or some other family member.

Do you have any ideas on how to deal with this kind of social anxiety? I don´t think is very difficult of a matter because my brothers, who aren´t very extroverted like me, they are able to pass though the days with ease, without worrying too much of the outside world. Specially, because they aren´t in school/university/volunteering yet like me...spending their time sleeping and playing video games...and I am the only one in my family who is truly extroverted.

She has a history of various cancers and active untreated skin cancer, COPD, emphysema and still smokes and has smoked for 60 years, she has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, history of pulmonary embolism, blood sugar issues, and a recent history of substance abuse. She was in the ICU only 4 years ago with full respiratory failure and carbon dioxide poisoning and by some miracle was able to survive without needing to go on a ventilator. 

We live in a moderately-hard hit region of New York State. She lives in a house with my 81yr old grandfather, who has substantially fewer health problems but is old so, not great.

They are opening hair salons in my region this week. She is a very vain woman and before lockdown, she went to the hair salon 3 days as week every week for 50 years. We warn her over and over about going out. We delivered her groceries and cigarettes and everything she needed for 3 months to make sure she didn't go out. Now she wants to throw it away because she needs to get her hair done even though she's barely seen another human being in 3 months besides her husband? 

She wants to go to the nail salon too. She will inevitably have to go out to get her skin cancer treated and have her routine doctor's appts for all her various issues, but everything else is not necessary. She lives in a big house on a secluded property and has plenty of space to roam, nature to see, sunlight to take in, pets who love her, socially distant visits with her family while she sits high up on her balcony, and no financial worries. 

She's is not healthy and will not live very long anyway. I'd prefer when she did, I could be holding her hand and talking to her, not her dying alone in the COVID ward with no visitors.

I have had no other symptoms at all and I’ve been very cautious, so there is a chance this could be just allergies or something. I want to get a test just in case, but I’m also very nervous that if I don’t have covid19, I will just wind up contracting it by going to the local urgent care to get tested where other people who were positive have been (the urgent care and the hospital are the only places offering tests where I live). Is this a ridiculous thought process?",2020-06-08 01:29:52

I shared about it here, that I got it from going to the doctor’s office. I started coming down with it again this week but I’ve had so little social exposure. I went to the orthopedic doctor twice and took precautions. 

I’m wondering if this is actually a relapse, viral reactivation?  The George Floyd incident has triggered my PTSD from a very similar incident happened to me in 2007.  Been awake for 3 days stressed out anxious and run down. It’s milder this time but still kind of horrible. I’m having all the same symptoms but more gastrointestinal which makes me think possibly if I was exposed again that I got it through oral route. Been vomiting and nauseated all morning.  Sneezing, eyes and sinuses messed up, sore throat, drenching sweats. Been using zinc, Zicam spray, zithromax eyedrops, and hydroxycloriquine.

I live in Austin Texas and went to the city website and try to schedule testing through the public health. Earliest appointment I could get was in five days. I went to the CVS online and scheduled drive-through testing the same day. They gave me a swab through the pharmacy drive-through and swabbed  myself and put it in a dropbox. I expect the results to be positive. Had two false negative swabs last time.",2020-06-07 20:00:38

Maybe it's my personal ""isolation madness"" talking though...I can't tell anymore. I really DO feel like I am slowly going mad...and it makes me so irrationally, illogically angry at our government.

I just want us to move on up to phase 2! G\*DD\*MMIT!!! I can't STAND this! What is this 1.5 nonsense?! I am logically aware that it may be do to other complicated factors from nationwide protest stuff and other things...these days are truly crazy days...like whoa. I am normally a very liberal social justice warrior and ally for diversity and change and liberation and progress. I would be considered a ""dirty socialist"" by conservatives, and I am fine with that.

However, this disappointment at feeling further cooped up...the lack of moving forward further with phases...all the confusing information...yeah, driving me slowly mad. It is all a$$hattery! I also just really wanted to use that word because I love it right now! That's not relevant, but who cares!

I just want to feel free to get out and be around human people again...it will suddenly start to hurt and really crush me all at once, and I crumble into a sobbing heap. I sob and cry heavily for a long time. I've also been getting more and more frequent stress headaches that increased doses of tylenol barely touch, my neck and shoulder muscles are painfully stiff...I wish I could throttle someone with glee. Preferably if the coronavirus were a personified human that I would happily throttle and scream ""This is all YOUR fault!"" Then I would gleefully launch them into the sun while cackling like mad! Yeah! Take that you stupid virus!

I don't care if this post gets flagged or deleted for being and sounding really weird...I know it's allllllll over the place. My brain feels like it is all over the place. I just...I just really want out. Let. Us. Out.

I'm going to go and lay down again because my headache is spiking again. I'm pretty sure it isn't related to the virus. I used to get these types of stress-headaches in the past.

I wanted to buy a fishing pole so I could learn to fish and enjoy time outside in a safe way. All of the big box stores that have strict COVID policies were out of ones that I could afford so my boyfriend and I ended up at a small mom and pop store. We were wearing masks but as soon as we walked in we were approached by an employee who was not wearing a mask.  


 He immediately started helping us get set up with fishing supplies and I know I should have asked him to step back or found a way to leave the store but I'm really bad at confrontation and didn't want to hurt the guys feelings because he was really nice and friendly. So I was polite and rushed it as much as I could but we were probably in relatively close contact for 20-25 minutes which I know is long enough to contract COVID. To top it off, he mentioned he was in the hospital last week for something unrelated. But if he was in the hospital last week I'm scared he might have picked it up there.   



We just got home and I keep thinking that a fishing pole wasnt worth my life. It was supposed to be my 27th birthday next week and I'm so scared to spend it in the hospital or intubated. I'm a former paramedic and all I can think about is one of my last patients I treated who died of a respiratory illness and how he struggled.

They did Zoom practices for the past 3 months but this week they opened up the studio for rehearsals again. Precautions were not mandatory. The teachers were not taking precautions. There was no distancing enforced. My daughter (11) and son (6) and I all take classes. We did not participate this week. I sent them a message that we were not comfortable with it. 

Today is dance picture day at the studio. Based on what I'm seeing on the book of faces, there is still no distancing being enforced. We are now skipping picture day too and I'm about ready to just pull my family for the rest of the dance season which should have already been over. I'll eat the price of our dance costumes.

I received an email from work late Friday telling me I was expected in work first thing Monday, but I am very worried about going back. There was no mention of staggered shift times (I work in a very large office of 300+ people to the building) and the sanitary of the place before this pandemic was absolutely dire. I would also have to get public transport to and from work each day which involves two packed trains at peak times.  I have a disability which if I were to contract this virus my body wouldn't do a good job in fighting it off. I unfortunately did not get a letter stating I was on the vulnerable list, which I think many of us with health conditions thought we would.

I wrote an email to my boss after hearing the news, but I know he won't be able to get back to me before I would have to go in on Monday morning, but I am not planning on going in until I get a reply from him. Would me not going in lead to my dismissal/ or if I were to hand my notice in would I be expected to work a two week notice?

I understand it's a very hard and difficult time for everyone, and I do not want to seem ungrateful for having a job, I am just wanting to put my health before money as my body is unable to fend illnesses off.

Sure I go and pick up food whether it's actual groceries or take out, but even with places reopening I don't feel safe to go to anywhere else that I haven't already been doing.  


I feel like the more places I go to the more of a risk I have to COVID19 even with businesses following CDC guidelines. Infact a reason I don't go is because I just lost the enjoyment of going somewhere to have fun that doesn't have a huge list of regulations to follow. Also I think I am just used to the stay at home thing by now and gotten used to this routine of going to work, coming home, going to work, coming home, etc. that unless they come out with a vaccine I am not going anywhere that isn't essential.   


It's deadly due to the fact either you could die from it, or spread it to someone else who is weak to it and get them sick or killed. Nothing would make me feel worse than a report coming out that someone had died because I visited Wendy's with the virus. Even if you take the test and it comes out negative you can still get COVID19 anytime and from anywhere.   


I honestly think if I can go out and enjoy life before the pandemic came about that I would need a vaccine so I wouldn't have to worry about getting the virus. I wouldn't have to worry about potentially getting it and it affecting me or someone else. I could go somewhere without fearing the virus and that would be the greatest feeling to me.   


Until we are given a vaccine that we can all feel safe and go out to have fun like we all used to, I think I will just keep doing my thing even if it's affecting my mental health going somewhere else would make me worry the whole time it wouldn't be worth going out.",2020-06-06 01:16:37

Since this all started I haven't left my house at all. I've been terrified of catching it because my weight and untreated hypertension. I had a telephone appointment with a doctor who told me to go to ER. Which I did. Biggest mistake of my life!

They heard shortness of breath and took me to the ""respiratory triage"" area. Nurse left while I listened to some woman who I couldn't see cough and hack nonstop for ten minutes. Despite the almost zero percent chance of exposure before hand they still tested me, during which my mask flew off. Nurse said she'd bring me a new one and when she came back her own mask was below her mouth and she was playing on her phone. She didn't bring me a mask and I never saw her again.

I called the hospital on my cell to ask for a mask. No one came. Eventually a nurse came to get a urine sample, so I got a mask from her. She gave me a cup and directed me to a portapotty. I had a saline drip bag connected to my right hand and when I expressed concern about maneuvering everything she said to just hold the bag and she left.

I cried in that portapotty for awhile before I realized the small non ventilated bathroom used exclusively for possible coronavirus patients was the worst place to hyperventilate and wipe tears from my face. There was no hand sanitizer in there. In fact my whole 4 hours there I never had access to sanitizer or wipes at all.

The nurses were uncaring, I was straight up forgotten about, and I had to explain to a doctor the reason my urine sample was so dark was because my period started. The heart attack symptoms were not addressed past an ekg test.

Why can't COVID19 be detected from taking a blood test?

For starters, it doesn’t help being surrounded by people who even think the virus is airborne and you’ll get infected the second you walk out. 

But like everywhere I go, stores and the gym and all that I constantly feel like the virus is on every surface, and that I can’t touch anything and or the air around me is infected. It’s even bad that after I go out I go home and take a shower to “disinfect.” But I’m trying to put things in perspective. The city I’m in has around 6500 infected with a population of around 790,000 or so, which is very low but obviously no one knows if they have it or not after a few days while potentially infecting others.

512,"Starting to develop a little bit of a cough but I’m unsure if it’s allergies or the virus, I’m panicking and need help",3,gxhnca,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gxhnca/starting_to_develop_a_little_bit_of_a_cough_but/,5,"I’m sorry for this word vomit that I’m about to write out, but I’m on the verge of a panic attack and writing down all of my thoughts typically helps me calm down.

TL;DR-I’ve developed a cough with no other symptoms, worried it could be Covid, and even more worried that my high risk husband will catch it from me and die. 

I will preface by saying I have been extremely careful in regards to coronavirus. I have diagnosed OCD, and this virus has really caused a lot of anxiety in me because a lot of my OCD revolves around illness/disease. With that being said, I’ve washed my hands so much that they are literally a different color than the rest of my skin and I’m very conscious not to touch my face, even before any of this started. My husband is also high risk so I try to be extra cautious for him as well. I’m a teacher that has been working from home. The only times I’ve left the house in the past 2 weeks were for a trip to get groceries 11 days ago (wore a mask, washed my hands and cleaned all of the groceries when I got home, then took a shower), and this past Monday I had to go clean out my classroom (there were very few people in the building, but of the people in the building, nobody wore a mask. I wore my mask when I was intentionally going to interact with someone, but I did not wear it in my room/hallway because nobody else was in my area of the building. There was one instance where one of the custodians walked past me in my hallway when I didn’t have a mask on and I’ve been thinking about that moment non stop). I didn’t get a chance to wash my hands while I was at school, but I used hand sanitizer non stop and am 100% sure I did not to put my hands anywhere near my eyes, nose or mouth. As soon as I got home, I washed my hands, cleaned my phone, then took a shower. I do take walks with my husband and dogs without a mask on, but we stay very far away from people when we do that. On top of all of this, there are not very many cases where I live. There have been 99 total confirmed cases since March in my county, with 21 confirmed active cases. We have around 2-3 new positive cases each day, but the testing here is also astronomically low so that could be inaccurate.

I am starting to develop a cough. The cough feels like it’s coming from a tickle deep in my esophagus, but the coughing seems to be involuntary and happens more if I breathe in very deeply. I’ve been kind of having an on and off sore throat as well for the past few days, but that’s gone now and it’s just this weird tickle cough thing. I don’t feel sick at all otherwise, I have no fever, no shortness of breath, no body aches, no nausea or anything. I’m inclined to believe it’s allergies, but I am the biggest hypochondriac and can’t be sure. I have a hard time calming down when I spiral, and I feel like this one symptom is sending me into a HUGE spiral. I think if I did have the virus I would likely be fine because I am 25 and healthy, but I really worry for my husband. I hold a lot of guilt and fear of spreading illness to him in general because a little over two years ago, I gave my husband the flu and he almost died from a secondary pneumonia infection that he developed, which sent him into septic shock, had him intubated in the ICU for a week, had a 3 hour surgery to remove the infection and insert 3 chest tubes, had him hospitalized for 2 weeks and on IV antibiotics for 2 months.

I just feel so stupid that for 3 months, my life was hell. Didn't see my loved ones, even though they were all still hanging out with each other. Didn't go out to eat, even though everyone else was doing take out. Didn't get to celebrate friend's birthdays/graduations even though everyone else did. Didn't go to the grocery store, only ordered delivery. Wasted so much money on disinfecting wipes and products. My hands are cracking and bleeding.

514,Nervous bc grandparents going to babysit little cousin,3,gxghli,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gxghli/nervous_bc_grandparents_going_to_babysit_little/,5,"Hi all,

I quarantined in my apartment alone since mid-March because I had plans to move in with my mid-70s  grandparents since before the virus. I've been here for a few weeks now and although things have began reopening, we are obviously playing it safe because of their age. However, if  my grandparents had their way, they would  be back to normalcy already; the only reason they play it safe at all anymore is because of me. 

I have a ten year old cousin who I know has not played it safe at all this whole time because her and my aunt regularly post themselves out and about (and even post selfies in public bathrooms) since the virus began. My uncle (her dad) also works as an RN at a pediatric urgent care and administers COVID testing. My grandparents are aware of this but they refuse to reject family if family asks for help. 

I'm pissed, and scared, because my grandparents informed me that she will be spending the night tomorrow. My uncle  asked them to watch her overnight and didn't give a reason, which more than likely means they simply want a break.

I don't know what to do because my uncle/aunt are not concerned for the virus anymore at all. It's highly likely my cousin has it asymptotically. There is no talking to them or my grandparents about it as both have already made up their minds. I'm super concerned my grandparents will get the virus and be hospitalized. And I'm also worried I will get the virus (I'm 25f and I don't have major underlying conditions but I am overweight and I catch viruses such as the cold and flu multiple times a year.)

I know no one can solve this problem in the sense that my cousin will spend the night here no matter what but I guess I'm looking for some sort of comfort  or ideas to cope. :(

I'm planning on staying in my room the whole time with my dog but I know this will make everyone mad at me as they will interpret it as rude.

I dont know if this is the place to post this, but i dont know where else to go with it. This is long so i understand if you dont read it all, but id really appreciate some help and i felt the context was needed.

Basically i am struggling with lockdown and my perseverance and patience are staring to wear thin. Im from the UK and i havent seen anyone apart from who i live with (partner and our 2 year old) since a week or two before lockdown started because we wanted to be cautious early due to my mum and dad both having health issues that would put them at risk. 

Both my mum and dad have received letters advising they shield completely, my dad has be furloughed and they havent left their house. At first, this was okay. After the first month it got hard. 

My partner is an essential worker and as such is still working full time, so i am often alone in the house with my child, who i love so much but she is constantly go go go, she has such high energy its unreal. Shes also always stuck to my hip, VERY clingy and its gotten worse since lockdown tbh. As such she throws tantrums as soon as my attention is not on her, and has made it extremely difficult to keep up with housework or anything really. 

Im aware it sounds like i am complaining over trivial things and should just get over it and get on with it. But i have been suffering anxiety and mild depression since my daughter was born. Things were improving before lockdown, but now my head is a mess. My mental health has plummeted. Its such a nightmare to try and do anything round the house that ive ended up just giving up, and now i am buried in housework that im struggling to catch up with. i know its sounds so stupid because its just housework but its making me feel even worse because i feel so incapable of basic tasks. Even when my partner gets home or is off there are only so many hours in the day and im so depressed that im struggling to motivate myself to do much.

For the last few weeks, ive had several occasions of breaking down and crying because i just feel so alone, overwhelmed and stressed out. I have never felt worthless before in my life, but recently at my worst points i feel so useless and worthless that its scaring me. 

Yesterday i absolutely lost it with my other half over almost nothing and i just broke down. I called my mum and cried and cried and i felt awful cause i know my mum will worry but i just needed to have someone 'with' me, i didnt want to sit and cry alone. My partner is very supportive btw but at that time we'd just argued so i didnt want him to comfort me. I told my mum that ive had enough now, i cant do this anymore. I feel so isolated and its killing me. 

Now to get to my real dilemma. My mum and dad have asked me to send my daughter to their house this weekend for a day to give me a break. I feel so in two minds. I am really starting to fall apart, and i really need a break. But my mum and dad are both at high risk of serious illness from covid :( ive spoken to them about this and they are both adamant that they are okay with accepting that risk, they miss her to death anyway and they can tell im struggling. But my partner works in a shop and although we take all the precautions we can, im still scared to send my daughter to my parents incase we are infected and dont know.

It could quite literally kill them. And i feel like such a selfish bitch for even consisering it, but i really am because i dont know how much more i can take. 

So, would i be a selfish, inconsiderate dickhead if i let my high risk parents take my daughter for a night? 

I duno if it makes a difference but i will list the precautions my partner takes with working -
Frequent hand washing, sanitizer and disposable gloves are provided in work, he doesnt work on tills, the shop only allows 3 customers at a time, the staff keep their distance from one another and the customers. When he comes home, all of his work items are put in a bag and left untouched until he goes back to work, His uniform is washed immediately after every shift, he washes his hands, disinfects his phone and then gets a shower. He does not touch me or his daughter or anything until he is clean.

it also turns out that many of my friends and family are shocked by this too.  i'm not surprised by this. this has resulted in many of them articulating their shock much more tactlessly than i would've expected from people who i consider close to me.  even if they haven't intended to offend me, asking me why i've been laid off when my now-ex company seems to be doing well, and that surely the world would need people in my role at the moment, has only made me more frustrated.  i didn't think that i would have to explain to people that this is just planting the seed in my mind that maybe it's me rather than covid-19 that is to blame here, and that maybe i suck after all.   it also doesn't help that i live in a country that has, at least in a relative sense, escaped the worst of covid-19 from both a public health and economic perspective, although some repercussions are still likely to take hold.  plenty of explaining to do.

even when i'm physically removed from the comments, they stay with me.  i've spent the last twelve years dealing with anxiety and depression, and with that, an overly critical inner dialogue.  over the past six weeks, it's been common for me to vacillate between not sleeping for days at a time and oversleeping, along with overreacting - or straight up reacting incorrectly - to fairly minor occurrences.   when i go to sleep or when i encounter minor setbacks in my day, it ends up being an opportunity for me to feel like i'm failing myself and that this is all on me.

i'm lucky to be able to stay with family for emotional support and have some close friends who have proactively checked in on me.  however, i'm also aware that this is a difficult time for a lot of people and don't want to overwhelm them.   work, and feeling like i can use my skills and knowledge productively, has important to me since i was a kid.  no amount of job applications, networking, volunteering, and exercise can seem to shift my perspective in the way that i need it to in these odd times.

i'm hoping that hearing from people in similar situations to me will make me feel less alone, particularly as i know maybe one or two people in industries that aren't obvious who are dealing with this.

Call 911 if you don’t think you can stay safe.” The changes caused by the pandemic set me over the edge. Even though I had a job, I couldn't work. 

The local residential facilities are either not appropriate for my diagnosis (i.e. substance abuse or eating disorders only) or don’t accept my insurance.  My insurance doesn’t have any out of network benefits and paying out of pocket would cost more than I make in a year. I was referred to an in network facility that is in another state, about 2,000 miles away (I am currently living with family). 

I looked at their website and here are some of the precautions they say that they are taking for Covid-19:

* Required COVID-19 testing as part of admission criteria
* Obtained cleaning and protective health equipment
* Closed campus, limiting visitors
* Health screening on employees, clients, and all essential visitors 
* Introduced masking and educated on mask care with employees and clients
* Comprehensive approach to social distancing on and between campuses

This is long, so I apologize. 

I live in Western NY where the cases of Covid19 are not very active, at least in my county confirmed cases are low. My family on the other hand, including my parents, brother, sister in law, niece and nephew, live in Long Island, NY where the cases are still very high despite the cases having lowered in severity since April. My parents and my brother’s family live next door to one another and share a backyard, so they’ve all been quarantined with one another, except for the two weeks after my sister in law gave birth to my niece in April. They quarantined separately for that period of time and then joined together again after that two week period. My parents have literally not left the house in 3 months, and my brother’s family has not left the house since they took their newborn to the pediatrician a couple of days after she was born, back in April. They get groceries delivered and have been cleaning absolutely everything they come in contact with, including groceries, mail, and more. They are very cautious and conscientious, and take this virus very seriously. I have also been doing the same. I don’t leave the houses, except I have been getting groceries once every two weeks because I live in a small town and grocery delivery is expensive and hard to come by. I am very cautious because my husband is high risk. I’m also a huge germaphobe with fairly severe OCD (both diagnosed), so I take this situation very seriously. Probably too seriously, my hands are a completely different color than the rest of my skin because of the hand washing, but that’s a whole different story. 

I would really love to visit my family on Long Island, because I want to meet my baby niece and see my parents. I haven’t seen any of them in a long time, and I never would have guessed that the last time I saw them would be it for a while. If I visit, I would drive and stay with my parents. Once I am there, I would not leave the house at all, except to go to my brothers house right next door. I would have to get gas once on the way because my car cannot make it the entire drive (7 hour drive). I would not use the bathroom or purchase food on the way (I have a bladder of steel and never use the bathroom while traveling to visit my family, even without a pandemic, and I have a gluten allergy so I can’t even eat typical traveling food anyway). 

Here’s my biggest dilemma that changes things quite a bit. My parents are driving to their second home in South Carolina this weekend and staying for 2 weeks because all of their summer clothes are located there, and they want to check up on their house. While they are there, they plan on doing basically the same things they have been doing while quarantining on Long Island, aka grocery delivery and deep cleaning, BUT my dad plans on golfing while social distancing, and my mother plans to walk on the beach early in the morning before others arrive at the beach. They also do not plan on stopping except for gas on their trip. By the time I would travel there, it would only have been a week since they will have returned, which is my biggest worry. 

Would I be taking a large risk doing this? I don’t really worry for me. I am 25 years old and healthy and I believe I would likely recover from the virus if I caught it. I worry for my husband (who almost died 2 years ago because of pneumonia caused by the flu and I could potentially be bringing the virus home to). I also worry for my parents, who are over 60 years old but relatively healthy. I would love some input. I’m a very anxious person, and I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking all of this. I don’t want to be selfish, but I don’t know if I can wait to visit my family until a vaccine is available without having some sort of breakdown. I wish I lived closer to them, that way I would be able to just visit outside from a distance but that’s not possible in my situation.",2020-06-05 07:33:00

This year has got to be one of the most mentally draining years we have ever faced. So much is happening within a short time frame that it's a lot to take in. In a matter of a couple of months we went from worrying about a virus, to worrying about your job security, killer bees, protests and riots that is happening across the world.  


All of this happening at the same time is just making me more anxious and more uneasy with everything going on. I don't think anyone could argue that this is one of the worst years we have had in our life time. There might be one or two other years that had incidents, but nothing compared to this and everything happening at the same time.

I know other people are dealing with the virus and racism at the same time. I just can't help but feel mentally drained from it all.   


I've gotten to the point where I am just mentally exhausted with what is going on. Having to process a lot of things going on around me is taking a toll.

I woke up and started browsing indeed today and I saw some jobs that I'm qualified for hiring (fast food, retail) but a lot of the ads were posted 30 days ago. Has anyone been having trouble finding minimum wage work? I heard thats whats been affected the most.

Also, I read that when the american economy collapsed in 2008 it wasn't until around 2010 that jobs started becoming few and far inbetween. Do you think right now restaurants/retail places are hiring people who are willing to work through the outbreak but in a few months time jobs will be impossible to find?",2020-06-04 18:25:39

He is the only person I want to break social distancing for, and I have gotten rather touch starved being holed up with my family for nearly 100 days. I was originally going to ask if it would be safe for me to hug him, as we both have been pretty safe and only going on walks, and I don't know if I can trust myself to *not*  hug him when I see him. We both live fairly close, so we wouldn't have to fly to see each other, and we would be outside, so I know that eliminates some risk, but I am still weary. 

However, that has changed. My town had a small protest last night, in a big area where social distancing was possible, and masks were worn by everyone. I remained socially distanced for the whole time, but my mother did not, and even though we were wearing masks, I am terrified she has gotten it or I have gotten it. I still am seeing my bf in 2 weeks and now I am paranoid that I could be asymptomatic and give it to him. (I strongly believe he doesn't have it, he has been very safe) I was extremely safe up until now, I only have been going on walks at night when less people are around, and my family has gotten groceries delivered, all of which we wipe down with clorox wipes. I was just starting to accept and justify hugging him when I do see him, rather than sitting just 6ft away, because of how safe we have been, but now due to my mother's actions I am severely second guessing that, and am paranoid that if I am asymptomatic, 2 weeks does not seem like a long enough time for it to go away. 

I am extremely mad at my mother, as she knows how paranoid I am, but instead of stopping being close to people, she got mad at me for being worried. My parents say I can't live like this forever and get mad at me when I get paranoid, but I can't control it and I don't know what to do. I realize it seems trivial to be this worried about hugging someone, but I thrive off of physical affection, so I'm sort of desperate at this point, but also I get really paranoid and scared about possible hazards (Just ask anyone I know about the time I got on a ""look up everything about lead paint and how to avoid it"" kick). I suppose I am asking is it still safe for me to hug my boyfriend when I see him in a little over 2 weeks?  Sorry if this is way all over the place and makes no sense, I can clarify anything if need be.",2020-06-04 19:28:12
534,Weeks of unhealthy isolation has taken it's toll on my mind.,25,gw40n1,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gw40n1/weeks_of_unhealthy_isolation_has_taken_its_toll/,9,"First time post.

35F female living in Seattle, WA area. This pandemic stuff has been really friggin awful for me, as it has for many others here on this page. My mental health has ""regressed"" to very unhealthy levels since the lock-down orders...it feels like my days are a numb nightmare. I have suffered from major depression and anxiety since I was a kid, and more recently some ptsd stuff...fun times. I have a good therapist and psychiatrist, and I take my meds regularly every morning, a drug cocktail that seems to do well for me...at least under NORMAL circumstances. I have still kept up with my medication and therapy sessions by phone...but those things feel like they are just BARELY helping to keep me together.

As I mentioned before, I feel like my mental health has regressed. It's the isolation, and the lack of freedom to be out and do whatever I please. Even when I feel particularly anxious and introverted, I often feel better when I force myself out of my home to go to a park or see friends or something.

My city is supposedly supposed to finally switch to ""level 2"" phase of reopening...and I have been eagerly awaiting this time, after feeling crushed with disappointment a month ago when the lock-down was extended...jesus. That felt awful...I can't stand this.

Don't misunderstand, I take all precautions that I can when I go out and do things, I wash my hands, I wear gloves and my mask which I clean. I am mindful of distancing between myself and others. I have no problem with taking those sorts of precautions...it is mostly just the feeling of confinement and isolation that is really messing with my head. I know I have been lucky in that nobody I know in my family or friends has suffered from covid-19...but when you are in a deep pit of despair from depression, you can not clearly see the things that should be viewed as a positive or a blessing. All I can see is endless misery.

I miss my friends, I miss my family...I miss seeing my doctors in person...therapy over the phone somehow doesn't feel ""real"". I've tried video over zoom...but it somehow feels too fake and exhausting for me, so we dropped it. I'm glad to have the therapist that I have, she is no doubt dealing with other clients who are struggling like I am with all this stuff.

This is such a weird time...especially with other added stuff now recently happening in major cities, but I won't say what by name since we are supposed to avoid potentially controversial political related stuff here. Crazy times indeed.

Anyway, I had been meaning to writing on here for a while, just looking for some sort of communal support from others who are struggling. I know others are struggling, but it hasn't taken away my feeling of alienation.

We are human after all, we are social creatures by nature, even those of us who are usually very introverted still need some form of sociability (I don't think that is a proper word...sorry =P). So naturally, we are drawn to others.

Anyway, thanks for reading.",2020-06-04 02:14:17

If that is the case I am curious to know how many are protesting right now? It's not millions of people but its not some little protest either.

A friend of mine knows I've been having a really tough time and yesterday invited me out for a drive to get some food and just kick it, even prior to the virus I haven't seen this friend in months so I decided to just go for it. We drove around for like an hour, everything was honestly feeling pretty good. She invited me back to her place with her boyfriend and kid to hang some more and I was feeling too good to let the day end early so I agreed. So they've got a set up in the basement of this house, I was a bit worried about the close proximity but we weren't up in each other's faces but we weren't across the room either. For those few hours I played blocks and stuff with her daughter, we all talked and laughed, it was a really nice time that I needed. Time got away from us and before we knew it, it was after 1 in the morning and she offered that I can sleep over and so I did. I didn't really sleep that well cause I was freaking out we were all just passing the virus back and forth but morning came, and they dropped me back off.

They're both 27 and haven't been hospitalized or have dealt with any really heavy symptoms and I myself am 25 so I figured I can't lock myself in my apartment forever and I just took the plunge and wanted to have a good day for once.

I am writing about them because honestly they put a huge dent in human interaction. We can't see when someone is talking to us even though we can hear their voice, but we can't see their lips moving. We can't see how someone is feeling, We can't hear them properly some of the time and as long as we keep seeing masks the more it just makes things feel uneasy.

This might be overreacting or silly, but one of the huge reasons I hate the mask thing is it constantly reminds you of the pandemic itself. Don't get me wrong I know it's good to wear one and I will continue to for as long as the states mandate it. I just hope that when this does die down we can go back to not wearing face masks.

I love seeing the joy on people's faces when they are happy. I can tell when someone is upset and they are holding it back. I can see how a person is feeling based on how their face is reacting to whatever emotion they are feeling. I can't see any of that behind a face mask and that to me is a depressing social interaction. I thought I would be relived talking to someone that was outside waiting for food with me while we were six feet apart.

I'm just in a really bad place and struggling with this whole thing. In particular, I have lately been struggling with the idea of social distancing lasting forever. I'm not a terribly social person but the idea of never being able to get within six feet of someone outside my household is making me incredibly depressed and anxious. Zoom meetings don't replace the real thing for me. Neither does talking to people six feet apart with masks on. I get that those things are necessary right now. But they actually make my depression worse.

I've been trying to avoid the news as well because that doesn't help my anxiety. Though it's often impossible because I live with my dad and he pretty much always has the news on. So early this morning I overheard a news report in which the mayor of I believe Newark NJ was quoted by the reporter as saying something like we need to live with this new normal because the old pre-COVID normal is never coming back.

So obviously, this immediately got to me since I've been fearing this. I don't live in or even anywhere near Newark NJ. I live in a different east coast state. But hearing this from an elected official made this feel more real. Like maybe it's not just my anxiety talking and we really are going to have to distance forever.

I'm in my early 20s. And in a way, hearing that we may never be able to stop social distancing, I just don't know what to do. I know it's necessary right now but there's no way I can do this forever. If this really is the ""new normal"", I just don't think I can do it. People say stuff like ""this too shall pass"" but honestly it's hard to see that. As I said, I'm not terribly social. But I'm not sure I can live in a world where I will never be able to have basic human interaction again, with anyone outside my immediate family. And I definitely don't want to. But it makes me feel in a way like my life is over before it's really begun. I just don't see the point of anything anymore.

I got a job recently where I am around people all the time. I wear a mask since I can't social distance at my job. I also sanitize as often as I can, wiping things down left and right and using hand sanitizer as though my soul depended on it. 

I was saying goodbye to him and he reached out to me for an air hug. I broke down. I hugged him and kissed him goodbye because it will be a long time before I see him again. 

Even though I still wear a mask everywhere I go, my community has decided to stop social distancing (not that they ever started tbh). I've given up on being the only person I know to social distance. I've given up on sacrificing my relationships and mental health when everyone else is just doing whatever they want and have been for months. 

I have spent the last two months completely secluded from my loved ones and only going out for food and work. I finally broke. 

I'm moving in with him as soon as I can. I know I shouldn't have had physical contact with him like I did, but I'm only human and I miss those closest to me so much. 

I do live with my grandmother, who has been telling me to keep my relationship with my boyfriend alive by being with him. I've been trying to protect her by isolating like I have. She's not upset with me and she's glad I did, but I still know I shouldn't have. She says it's not fair for me to be the only one sacrificing the things I love.

I plan to completely isolate, should I get sick, by moving in with my boyfriend for the duration if the symptoms. I have also been tested for Covid and plan to be tested as often as I can be when the testing comes to town. Even if I don't feel sick, I think it's a good thing to do. It helps organizations gather data, too. 

Anyway, this has been a super hard time for all of us. I've really struggled with depression, probably the hardest I ever have. My boyfriend has also struggled a lot during our separation. Being away from everyone I love isn't normal... It's not healthy mentally... And I feel that.

I'm in dire need of videos from people who provide words of comfort and hope, kindness, that we can get through this. Not written words or voices with pretty backgrounds. I specifically crave videos of someone speaking directly to the camera. Doesn't have to be a famous person, but that would be great too (off the top of my head, people like Mr. Rogers, Oprah, Bernie, Richard Rohr, Brene Brown, Stephen Colbert, Jim Carrey, Michelle Obama, etc.).

Before this, I used to work, like a lot. Like on top of my 9-6 job, I had freelancing gigs and had to help my mom on the weekends. I needed the money so I have no choice since she's relying on me. Lately, I've becoming more uhh self-deprecating because all my friends seem to be doing lots of stuff during quarantine. I work remotely since before so I'm largely unaffected and my friends are office ppl who get paid time off during quarantine. 

idk I guess I just feel more miserable than normal. Like I'm so boring because I can't do anything while everyone is discovering new hobbies at home and I honestly dont have the energy to do much of anything else. It's starting to highlight how I dont have antyhing going for me aside from work and I know I should be grateful I have money but I jsut feel so miserable and tired and I cant explain why.

I'm quarantined a 24-hour flight, an ocean and two borders away from my boyfriend and our shared home. I'm stuck with family, which I'm dealing with as best I can, and they've helped me financially with food and small expenses, so I'm not in an immediately dangerous place. Some days I can cope. I'm truly doing everything I can to make my life better and contribute positively to the world. That said, I'm super depressed. I'm struggling to work with any real consistency, and I was freelance before this started, getting more known in my field and looking for a steady job... now that's out the window for the moment, because I'm honestly so depressed that I've struggled to focus. This week I learn whether or not I will be forcibly removed from my antidepressants, which I can't get a replacement for in this country... I had some shipped over a couple weeks ago and they're sitting in a processing center several states away from where I currently am in the US but I only have a few days left and no word on whether or not it's been approved, so my ability to cope could be ripped away from me any minute, and the anxiety is eating at me. I don't qualify for unemployment but I'm at the point of wanting to call in and at least see if there's something that can be done, because my time in the US has been extended indefinitely through no fault of mine, and my abilities to deal with the present situation are limited.

I'm beginning to feel sick, but I never know whether it's from catching the illness or from the shitty life conditions I'm in. I almost never leave my room because my family does not take social distancing as seriously as I do, and honestly, we clash a lot and I need to protect my mental health, or whatever is left of it. I just wanna scream all the time. The news just seems to get more horrible as time goes on, and there is no indicator of when I'll ever return home. I'm terrified that this is it for my seven year relationship, for my budding career, for my 30's... that everything is just gonna be ripped away from me and I'll just be a shell of a person for the rest of my life.

I am 22 years old. I'm living with my mom and my grandparents for the time being until I go to graduate school. Because of COVID, my mom is being very cautious.

1. She won't buy anything from a restaurant.
2. She only orders groceries from online.
3. She won't let anyone outside of the neighborhood.
4. She won't let me go back to school to retrieve the rest of my belongings (she says she will have my dad help).
5. She doesn't open Amazon packages until they've stay in the garage for 2 weeks.

This is to give you an idea of how cautious she is. Yes, I'm thankful for what my family provides me and that they care about me.

I've seen the comments left under our local news posts, under the Neighborhood apps, etc., and it really upsets me.  These are the type of posts that aren't just expressing doubt about the science behind the pandemic... while those make me roll my eyes that wouldn't stop me from leaving my house... but there was so much vitriol on these posts against people who supported the lock down or even just supported wearing masks.  Lots of comments along the lines of not caring if elderly or compromised people die, etc.  I've always known my values haven't always matched the values of my community members, and that has been ok as I feel like I'm making a difference from within, but the sheer number of brutal, no empathy, laughing-at-your-pain comments is frightening.

However, I have to physically return to work on June 15th, and quite honestly, am dreading it.

It has become evident even through mask wearing... hardly anyone in my town wears them, and I and two of my friends have noticed on separate occasions how hostile people are in person when they see you wearing a mask.  Is anyone else anxious about going out not because of the pandemic, but because of how hateful their local community has been towards those that are being cautious?

I know I sound crazy and i know we already give out info to Apple & Google and all of that but it seems so...oppressive and like scary historic events (okay fine, I’ll say it, it scares me that these slow movements that no one minded led to Nazi Germany &amp;amp; the Soviet Union.  I know I sound crazy but I’m serious).  Idk I keep thinking “those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it” and it freaks me out.

I just don’t like this.  It’s eerie, and people are so eager to contribute.  I’m sure you saw the article about the 170 privacy experts who warned against the contact tracing methods.  It’s alarming.  I’m really scared, but I don’t want to look crazy but idk... 

I couldn’t fall asleep last night because of it.",2020-05-30 04:02:12

But today I realize that the 600/week unemployment benifits expire on July 31st, and that's really scary. And I also read that SF isn't even going to reopen much til mid-Augest which is really scary because the city has no plan on supporting small businesses and individuals once the federal stimulus runs out. I'm right now thinking of becoming a cuddle therapist in July, but I can't help but think should the unemployment benefits expire and no new stimulus gets passed, how will I be able to get clients when no one has money. And even if I wanted a job like let's say an amazon delivery driver, will they end up cutting my hours because no one can buy anything because they have no money. I'm pretty scared right now on wether I'm going to survive financially and what will be left of SF once it starts to reopen?",2020-05-30 05:55:46
580,The longer the virus goes on the more I want to give up,41,gsrmru,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gsrmru/the_longer_the_virus_goes_on_the_more_i_want_to/,3,"I just want to make it clear that by giving up I dont mean my life. I know I still have my friend's, family and my girlfriend that I would never do that to them.

When I say giving up it just means giving up on the things that used to make me happy. Being able to travel to events, conventions, concerts, malls, to see my friends, going to parks and meeting new people. All of that is just gone and I am giving up that it will ever come back. I may not ever end my own life, but that doesn't mean I'm living a happy one.

Sure I got people who love me and I love them. I should just be happy and grateful for that and I am. Just when there were so many things that you loved to do, but you can't do them anymore or a watered down version of it it's depressing.

Not to mention now I fear the virus anytime I go out. With the CDC changing things on how we can get the virus who knows what to look out for. What if you could get it walking in an area that was completely empty, but because one person past by it earlier with the virus you somehow get it by passing through that same area the other person walked. What if you get it from touching something on a shelf that some other person touched. Folks say you can wear gloves, but then I have the anxiety of taking my gloves off wrong and touching it. Then they say that a face mask isn't as helpful to you wearing it more as it helps protect other people so I still fear the virus even wearing a mask. This just constant fear of the virus the moment you step outside of your home is awful. I know I shouldn't be worrying to that extent of getting the virus no matter what I do, but it can't be helped that I feel like this. 

All of this watered down version of life mixed in with the fear of the virus from even seeing someone that's more than six feet away is a horrible. Even if they give us the all clear and to not worry about it I'll still be worried. If they never say it's safe to go out without all these restrictions it'll be depressing.

I just feel like I'll never be able to go out and enjoy the life that I used to have. That I'll never be able to go out without fearing of getting the virus. Even if I go out with protection I will still be anxious about being out.i feel for others too with how this virus has been affecting people. Seeing folks losing their lives and losing their loved ones to this it's painful to see. You can't help but to feel awful for those this virus has affected, and you worry if it'll happen to your family, friends and loved ones. I just feel like giving up on the idea I could ever feel safe and happy again the longer this goes on.",2020-05-29 15:57:30
581,For anyone suffering from panic and existential crisis/depression right now!,6,gt0n1c,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gt0n1c/for_anyone_suffering_from_panic_and_existential/,2,"Edit: **Disclaimer:** Sorry if everything is kind of all over the place.  I've only recently been able to get a grasp of these feelings, but I hope you all take is as an honest and raw experience unlike those web articles and their ""tips"" for helping with depression. (yes I've also done that too)

A little more than a week back I made a post about my experience with existential dread and thankfully now I've gotten over most of it. I still get the occasional thoughts of life being hopeless and meaningless but I'm able to pull myself out of it now. Seeing how many people are struggling with the same feelings, I wanted to share what really helped me in hopes this will help others get over their thoughts.

**For anyone else that's gotten over their terrible feelings, please share so others can possibly benefit from it :D**

My original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19\_support/comments/gm8jo3/quarantine\_existential\_crisisanxietydepression/](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gm8jo3/quarantine_existential_crisisanxietydepression/)

This is a response I recently made to someone who came for advice (It's very long that's why I decided to make this a post) :

Hey, since I've posted this I've slowly gotten over it.

For me it was really bad for the first week and then it slowly progressively got better. I was scared, of death and of the meaning of everything. Sleep was the only peace of mind I got during this time and I dreaded waking up.

Don't immediately go to online therapy and rope yourself in a couple hundred dollar plan like I almost did. If you're like me, you may feel like you want to explode every waking moment and get terrible panic attacks. The way I dealt with it is simple breathing exercises you can find online to control the panic attacks first off.

In this time I found that its most important to ground yourself to reality. It gets worse if you dissociate from reality and get lost in your thoughts. Next time you find yourself lost, look around your and notice things around you. Go take a seat outside for a walk and look at the world around you.

The end goal is to understand whether life after death exists or has any meaning at all doesn't mean anything. The way I rationalized it is, if reincarnation exists then that's cool I wonder where I'll end up, if heaven and hell exists I hope god has mercy and lets me into heaven (I do believe in god), and if the possibility that theres nothing after death... Why do I care? I never cared or felt it before I was born, so its not like ill be there to experience nothingness after. So just while you are here and conscious, enjoy life, make friends, stop thinking about all these pointless things.

Don't get me wrong though, its not easy. Even now I still find my mind drift sometimes in something I would best explain as mood swings? I completely understand that it feels like complete shit and hopeless when you're in those thoughts but when you get out of them you get a clarity and once you taste that clarity even when you feel hopeless later you'll at least know this isn't how you really feel.

So here I I'll compile a short list for you of things that helped me get over my existential crisis and panic attacks.

1. Don't fear death (I dont mean be reckless but dont let the idea control your thoughts) Death is far, and not the end. (Or at least I like to believe so, nobody can say for certainty there's nothing after death. We barely know anything about our galaxy and have been confined to this small planet and only recently a bit outside of that. What do we know?)
2. Don't skip over the middle!!! ( What I mean by this is, if you're young and fearing the end of your life and picturing your deathbed and everything after. You are still far from that point, why think about it now? Even if you're in your 40s or 50s you can still have another 40-50 years to live. Do you know how long that is? It's very long but being lost in your thoughts you forget that easily.) Even if you are, god forbid nearing death or losing someone dear to you, refer to tip 1 and 3. Death isn't the end, and if it is nobody will be there to experience it  and there's peace in that. People love to say ""They're in a better place now"" after the passing of a loved one, and I like to believe that's actually true.
3. Religion (This might not be for everyone but if prayer and religion/believing in an afterlife soothes your mind. Go for it, it personally helped me.)
4. **(IMPORTANT)** Talk to your friends, don't do the same repetitive thing everyday. (Dullness caused by quarantine can make you feel like life is boring and not worth living. I spent every day doing the same thing for 3 months and I think that's actually what brought this on. So go outside, talk to old friends, make new friends, start a new hobby, work out, or whatever keeps your mind grounded. This step REALLY helped me, we are social creatures and isolation WILL drive us mad.) Sometimes the difference between existential dread and peace of mind/happiness is just a change of perspective and scenery, don't confine yourself to the same environment until it makes you feel numb.
5. Professional help? (I personally never got to this point but I almost did because I was desperate to make the shitty feelings go away. But if it becomes too overwhelming and nothing changes in a week, by all means seek professional help but try to see if you can get over it yourself.)
6. This one if kind of iffy, but for me understanding that you and your consciousness is more than just your brain relieved me. I like to believe we are more than a walking corpse and there's so much we don't understand about existence for us to jump to conclusions, we are not robots and we are not just a mind! (This might have just been situational to me but I'll put it here in hopes you have similar thoughts)

Sorry if this was a bit long, but I know how bad the feelings can get and I really hope this response helped anyone on this sub. To sum it up ENJOY LIFE my friend, stop dreading all the unnecessary thoughts, even if things are going to shit now remember you are in control of this life. If you feel like shit, its your mind making you feel that way, don't get lost in the thoughts. Make friends, makes goals, and we'll all get through this together :)

IF you have any doubts get an antibody test.

WEAR A MASK.

my dr responded saying I should isolate for a week and recommends me getting another antibody test in two weeks (ughhhh).

I’m a 26/F registered nurse who has been working pretty much throughout the pandemic. I live alone and haven’t seen my boyfriend and close friends for nearly 10 weeks. Some days it’s easy and some days, such as now as I go to work... is hard.

I’m a huge extrovert and I thrive in social interactions but it’s a bit different compared to only being able to see patients and colleagues.

I miss my boyfriend so much. He lives at home with his grandpa who is part of the at risk population. We make do with the distance by talking everyday (we’ve always talked everyday anyways) and by videocalling once or twice a week due to his work (he works from home). 

But I feel selfish because it isn’t enough for me. I’m growing more anxious and depressed as time goes by. People say treat this as a long distance relationship and yeah I get it but I have no social interaction outside of work. I just sleep because I’m tired from work and I’m depressed. When I was in a long distance relationship in the past, I had friends and family to spend time with to keep me sane.

I need to vent and cry before I get to another 12 hour which is in about an hour. Then after that, I gotta put on my smiling face for the shift and after that shift, I’ll be coming home to an empty home again until I go out for essentials or work...",2020-05-29 15:44:34

Five years ago she received a double lung transplant (she is 59). She is in excellent health now, but the virus would probably kill her. She has a 16-yr-old son who is my 17-yr-old son's best friend. We are both single moms and despite differing parenting styles overall (she's strict, I'm not), we love and respect each other and love that our boys are friends. The problem: I keep wishing she would allow her son to live in a household that doesn't require such extreme precautions, for the summer.

She has a sister who lives nearby who could be his caretaker, and of course I have offered, too. Her boy is having to live such a restricted lifestyle, it worries me. I understand it would be very hard for her to not have him near, but it doesn't seem fair to him. She does have supportive friends (including me) and is a very independent person who can take care of herself without his help.

If he were allowed to live away from her this summer, he could work an outdoor job with my son and enjoy lots of activities he can't enjoy now. We live in a rural area that is relatively low risk, but because of her compromised condition, she has to stay quarantined, and has to keep clear restrictions on her son's lifestyle. None of her restrictions are unrealistic, and I'm glad she is protecting herself, but I don't like that her son is having to live in constant anxiety over contaminating her. My son tells me that his friend feels trapped and miserable.

On the other hand, she's his mom, and it's really not my place to say what is right for him.

I've talked with my friend, and although she hates the situation and feels sad that her son has to be so careful living with her, she doesn't want to let him go. Thanks for listening, and for any feedback you can offer.",2020-05-29 18:40:52

We have 2 million citizens with 600.000 living in the capital Skopje (where I live).

We closed up pretty early, 11th of March the universities and schools and by the 13th everything except grocery stores and pharmacies was closed. We only had one case in my city at the time.

I sat through terrible anxiety and depression in lockdown since, for almost three months, locked inside my home, not seeing my friends, my brother or my grandmothers. I followed every rule. I never left the house without a mask even for a walk away from people. I have been cleaning floors and products daily (my mom has to go grocery shopping). We had a police enforced curfew since closing, no one allowed to leave their homes after 4pm until the next morning, old people could only from 8 am - 12 pm and young people from 12 pm - 4 pm so they won't mingle. On weekends we couldn't leave at all or face fines/jail time. During Orthodox Easter, our biggest religious holiday, we were locked in for 85 hours and not allowed to leave our houses. We went through all of that.

And suddenly they re-opened everything this week. Cafes, restaurants, malls, city transport, everything. There are still some rules and measures but it's open. No more lockdown. No more quarantine. People are on the streets in masses. And the number of infected is growing rapidly.

We have had 2077 confirmed cases, 121 deaths (which is a lot based on our population) and 470 active cases. About 230 of those are in my city of 600.000 population. My mom works as a nurse and my dad is a doctor, I worry for them. We stacked up supplies yesterday before they re-opened, a month worth of products and for fresh stuff and pharmacy we will go to our local small store since it's easier to avoid others in a store where only a block buys from. I don't know what to do. We have 10% of tests come back positive daily. 

I don't see this ending. I don't see feeling safe in this new world. Yet I envy those countries that beat it, that had 1-2 cases a day and keep it under control. I wish I lived there and I could go outside feeling safe and free. It's too much for my anxiety and I don't know how long this will go on.",2020-05-28 18:52:37

my father who is 69 years and currently in Bombay, India has tested positive for the corona virus. He iscurrently on day 11 since his symptoms started. Mainly his symptoms are:

\- Fever that fluctuates between 99 F - 102 F

\- Stomach discomfort and slight loose motions (once in 2 days - average)

\- Fatigue, weakness and overall tiredness

\- slight loss in appetite but he eats the food that he is offered

The doctor mentioned that his symptoms seem to be mild and if things had to flare up then they already would have. He is not facing any chest discomfort, short breathlessness, problems in smell of taste. His oxymeter readings fluctuate usually between 94-97%. He is diabetic and has hypertension.

The family is very anxious since none of us children are with them (mom and dad in Bombay, India). We are taking second opinions from Doctors in India and some are mentioning that he should be on Azithromycin whereas our primary doctor mentioned that he just continues to be on paracetemol, plenty of fluids, etc etc and no other treatment/hospitalization is required.

What do you'll think? Do you agree with his treatment? Did you'll or are having a similar experience? What has recovery been like? Do you think he should be hospitalized?

592,Did anyone else have a change of mood this week?,15,gsarmo,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gsarmo/did_anyone_else_have_a_change_of_mood_this_week/,18,"The weird thing throughout this whole experience is the collective mood. Like we have all gone through similar phases on a similar timeline, even though this experience is isolating, you are almost never alone in the way that you feel in any given time. There's a whole mix of emotions that everyone can feel, especially as our circumstances are different, but they all seem to follow this greater 'wave'.

For instance, when it all began I, and the people around me, and just people that I know in general, felt kind of a sense of excitement. This was like, right before lockdown through the first one or two weeks. 'Excitement' could manifest in a positive way, or a very negative way... or both... like a lot of high-strung emotions all around. There was sort of a novelty and fascination factor to the whole thing, fear, proactivity, wanting to reach out to people etc. Around this time my mother was very enthusiastic about speaking to people on the phone, while my dad became very depressed.

**Then came weeks 2/3. The crash.** After that flurry of emotions, there was a tipping point. I was personally in between fear, fascination, and novelty in the beginning but between these weeks I was more depressed and felt more hopeless than I ever had been. I gave up on the productivity and decided that it was fine to just lay in bed for a week... something that I would never ever normally do... but I probably needed it. At this time my dad also decided to get himself out of his depression and get on medication.

**Weeks 3/4. The gradual acceptance.** These weeks seemed to represent a time of gradually adapting to this, developing a more reasonable routine rather than deciding to be hyper-productive or hyper-unproductive. It was a more reasonable approach for a lot of people... this is the phase when the family zooms began. My friends started crawling out of the woodwork and we began to talk more too. I started in on longer-term personal projects.

**I'm forgetting the weeks now but Phase 4. Towards the end of the first month and the beginning of the second. Agitation, Dispair, How much longer does this have to go on?** So you're in your new routine now, productive or not... positive or not... you've settled into something that has been relatively consistent and despite being sad, you've sort of accepted that you just have to wait.... but enter this phase and you're starting to wonder what the point is again. When will it be over, etc? The positivity and enthusiasm of being with family at this point (if you're staying with a partner or family or friends right now) starts to wear off, people start arguing.

It's funny because I called my therapist and complained about my relationship (currently cannot get back to my husband) - she said that *every one of her clients had relationship complaints that week.*

**Phase 5**. **Re-acceptance.** Ok. One month down, let's just gear up for another - it's the beginning of May, summer is around the corner and even if things aren't getting better, the world is getting warmer and prettier which gives you a sense of improvement in some way or another. Bye for now seasonal effectiveness disorder... see you next year.  After getting that hump of being annoyed, angry, sick of the whole thing... you are now hunkering back down into your 'routine'. At this point your routine may have changed or intensified... for me... a personal project turned into a more serious joint project with a friend, which involved us video chatting every day and I felt a lot less lonely.

**Beginning of phase 6. YOU ARE HERE. A change in the wind.** This is what I'm wondering about specifically. I just felt a sudden change... maybe it has to do with the looming ""reopenings""... But I felt a very real and distinct change in my mood last Friday. I started to feel very tired and sick (got my period... but wound up having the worst one that I had in years), slept through the whole weekend after being otherwise productive with work and projects the month prior. I expected to come out the other side feeling better and ready to get back to what I was doing... but I feel completely distracted. Like my attention has shifted. I feel like I'm on the cusp of something - new news has come out about visas and whatnot and getting back to my husband... so that's on a personal level... but this 'unrest' is visible in the news as well... a lot of bizarre events have happened (the pool party, a plane crash, police brutality... etc.). I almost feel like I have fallen out of love with the project that I'm working on, and when I used to have the strength not to think about missing my husband, that factor is now in the forefront of my mind.

Things have changed for my friends too... one went back to work... a few others are moving to new apartments... some graduated... there are a lot of transitions.

I feel like I'm about to face an impending transition too and I just feel a lot of nervous energy. Nothing like the end-of-month exhaustion that I felt before.

&#x200B;

I'm not predicting anything! I don't really believe in horoscopes, tarot cards, whatever. But I do think that society's general undertones are translated across the board. These 'waves' are normally seen in the scope of generations, but now that we're all doing more or less of the same thing, dealing with more or less of the same thing, it has become so much more visible in a shorter scope of time. Especially seeing the people around me go through these patterns, as well as my therapist literally getting calls about the same types of issues from different people, varying from topic to topic each week.

Does anyone else here feel like there's a sense of change this month? Somewhat related to policy changes but also just in your general mood and personal environment? Like even if I were to stay exactly where I am for another month, I feel like my focus has completely shifted.

&#x200B;

EDIT: And to add... even before this all unfolded, back in January... I felt weird. When I dropped my husband off at the airport we had the understanding that we would be together in two months' time... even though that was a completely reasonable and logical expectation to have... I just somehow knew that it wasn't going to happen... that we wouldn't see one another for a much longer period. Being long-distance for two and a half years of our relationship, I can say the goodbyes never really get easier... but that was the first time that I really felt different.

My mental health is really bad during this time and I caved today— I’ve gotta see my family. I got stuck in my college town in March and haven’t seen them all year. So in July, I’m flying to Houston to see them. But I’m also very nervous.... I was wondering if someone call calm my anxieties about this?


For background I’m 20 years old, normal BMI (as of today actually! -33 lbs journey is over) and no known underlying conditions. My parents are in their 50s and relatively healthy (my dad has HBP, but that’s really it.) What’s my risk and how safe— or dangerous— is it to fly a United airlines Flight right now? And what can I do to prevent COVID?",2020-05-29 01:14:12
594,I feel anxious about people who judge others for going outside and doing riskier activities.,15,gs73c8,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gs73c8/i_feel_anxious_about_people_who_judge_others_for/,34," Repost because I hate the live discussion format, it's impossible to read on mobile. 

So first off I live in an area that was not hard hit at all by Covid. I have been doing my best to slow the spread for nearly three months now. Our government is slowly but surely lifting certain restrictions and I am eager to get back to a certain kind of normalcy.

I am normally not anxious about Covid itself, since I have been looking at raw data both from my province and from the rest of the world and I have personally determined that I am okay with the risk. I don't know anyone at risk and those I know who are at risk are taking necessary precautions.

In light of restrictions being lifted and small gatherings being allowed, my MIL invited my boyfriend and I over for a BBQ. It's been extremely hot here (like 32 ° C hot or around 88 ° F if I'm not mistaken) and it's especially hard to stay inside because of that. I have mentioned that I will go to her place (outside) for the BBQ and people on Facebook and Reddit have constantly posted things shaming other people for doing this or going to the beach or simply going outside. It makes me super anxious that they would say something like ""you'll be sorry once you'll catch it"" or ""why would you want your parents to die"" or something. This is probably their intention but I feel guilty about wanting to hang out with my family and friends now, even though I'm allowed, just like I felt guilty about going to the park earlier.

How do I detach myself from this and just ignore what these people say, while still taking precautions? I'm tired of being anxious every time I go out because I can only hear people judging me for doing so in the back of my mind.",2020-05-28 18:18:42

Now, I’m afraid none of that might ever happen.

My college sent me an email saying that we will most likely have a fall semester — with a lot of restrictions. All group activities are pretty much canceled, there’s social distancing, and I have to wear a mask. People are saying that this is our “new normal”.

Does this mean life will continue to be this way from now on? I understand that for this moment, this is what we have to do. But if I’m going to have to wear a mask every time I go somewhere for the rest of my life, or if shaking hands, hugging, and parties are all novelties of the past, then I don’t know if I can take it.

My city is opening in a very slow, careful way, maybe soon I can relax a little?

My ""journey"" started back in March. I'm relatively healthy (36M) and other than being obese (38%) I have no pre-existing health issues. I had to take a business trip to Toronto back in early March. I was there for one night and came back the next day. A few days later, my family and I (36M, 36F, 2M) took a trip to Winter Park, CO with some very close family friends. On the day before departure, we did a whole snowmobile tour and also visited a tubing hill. In the airport and on the plane ride home, my wife complained of feeling unwell and had a slight fever. She purchased some allergy meds and attributed it to seasonal allergies. Granted we didn't have any way to take her temp then, but her symptoms subsided by the next morning after we had gotten home.

The next day it was business as usual and we both went to work. The 13th of March is when I started experiencing some chest tightness and some warmness of my body. I decided to go to the doctor and was told it was likely just a virus. Over the weekend I didn't have many changes and the tightness continued along with some GI issues (very watery diarrhea). Monday the 16th, we all went to work/day care and I wound up going back to the urgent clinic due to chest tightness and low grade fever. I was diagnosed then with acute rhinitis and put on a few different meds. That next day I felt okay but still had chest tightness and that is when everything here in my state began closing down (I live in the suburbs of a large metropolitan city in Texas). We both started working from home and took our son out of daycare. Wednesday the 18th is when I felt a sudden rush that I had never felt before. I was constantly checking my temperature and at one point in the afternoon the thermometer ready 102.7. As I sat down for dinner I was extremely worried and frightened about what might be happening to me. I still had the chest tightness and GI issues but no cough, sore throat, etc. I took myself to the ER. I was hooked up to an EKG machine, O2 level of 94-95, no fever (had taken an ibuprofen earlier in the afternoon) and also given a chest x ray. The ER doctor diagnosed me with bronchitis and gave me a prescription for cough medicine and a z pack. He noted that even though I had a few symptoms of Covid, he was only allotted 30 tests/day for his hospital. I was discharged and sent home.The next day I slept until 1130am...something I hadn't done since my early twenties. I felt absolutely terrible and began the z pack regimen.

Over the course of the next few days, everything seemed to subside but I began having shortness of breath whenever I would exert any sort of energy (picking up clothes, changing sons clothes, making bed, etc)...I would still get extremely anxious...something I had never dealt with in my entire life. The anxiety/panic attacks wouldn't occur on a regular basis but when they did it was debilitating. The anxiety really had an effect on me. The shortness of breath went away probably 3-4 days after (seemingly close to when I finished my z pack).

I went to my GP two weeks ago and told him about my issues and also requested him to do work up labs on me as I hadn't had a proper physical since probably the 9th grade. Everything came back fine, aside from some bad cholesterol, but otherwise my health was great. He wound up prescribing me two different anxiety meds. I've since felt a bit better but still get some anxiety. For instance, Sunday we had our first curbside food since the start of quarantine and Monday we went to a big box home improvement store. Oddly enough, walking around there with my mask on didn't give me any sort of anxiety. Yesterday was a different story. I had scheduled a haircut for myself and my son and I don't know if it triggered something deep or what but yesterday afternoon was probably the worst I've had since the beginning. I wore a mask the entire time and my 2 year old did really well aside from it falling off for about 15 minutes. The barber shop was not full and everyone inside was wearing a mask and sanitizing hands as they walked in.

He starts daycare and swim lessons on Monday. Is it silly to still worry about him going to daycare? They are taking precautions at drop off and pick up but I still have this worry about the whole ordeal. My wife will continue to work from home for the time being but wont be able to watch our toddler all day as we have been with two parents home. I will be back in the office/out visiting customers beginning Monday. Does anyone have pointers on how I should approach this? My career is in sales and in order to win work for my building,  I am required to go visit people.

Today I feel okay but still worry about everything going on. I guess aside from venting here, based on some of y'alls experience/diagnosis, how possible is it that I had Covid-19 or are all of my symptoms attributed to this new anxiety? As I mentioned before, this is something I had never dealt with. I sometimes think it has to do with the fact that I got so ""sick"" at the beginning of the quarantine that it is what is causing me to worry so much coupled with the fact that I wouldn't want to risk getting my wife or son sick.

I appreciate allowing me to vent here. Does this sort of anxiousness eventually go away? I'm hoping that once a vaccine or therapeutic is out there, I'll be able to gain some sort of normalcy back. I'm usually pretty social but really have been out of touch with many of my friends. I speak to neighbors daily and try to exercise more (down 25lbs since March 13th) but I still get that anxious feeling of worry. I have to admit that I am bad about constantly checking for updates in hopes of a silver bullet vaccine/therapeutic announcement and also check too often regarding case counts/dates here in the state and surrounding counties.",2020-05-28 19:24:55

I've been daydreaming about planning a visit with her, especially given the strong possibility that there will be a second wave. I would do a strict 2-week quarantine and hopefully be able to get tested before going. There are several things that make this tricky - she is very healthy but she is higher risk because of her age (63). She and I also live in two of the hardest-hit cities in the US - she is in Chicago, I am in Boston. Flying would be a huge risk it seems, so I was thinking about driving but I would have to break the drive up into two days and therefore would have to stay somewhere overnight, stop and use the public bathrooms at rest stops, etc. But maybe by July/August it will be safer to do those things?

604,Am I being crazy?,2,gsabkg,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gsabkg/am_i_being_crazy/,3,"So a short intro. I’m a somewhat newly single mom (been broken up for nearly 6 months, baby daddy was verbally and emotionally abusive). I moved myself and my daughter in with my father and stepmother after the very nasty breakup. Prior to everything shutting down, I was doing pretty good, had a job and was slowly working toward fixing my life — then COVID-19 happened.

In any case, I was laid off when the pandemic started, back in March. Went through the shutdown mostly okay. I am kind of terrified of the virus, because I have moderate asthma and I am concerned that if I catch said virus, I will end up being one of the people that doesn’t make it. Not to mention the complications that are popping up in children.

Now things are opening up, and while my job hasn’t opened back up, there are lots of places opening back up. My father and stepmother want me to go out and find a job. I have expressed a desire to wait a bit longer to see how reopening works out — I honestly don’t trust that things are better yet, and my general experience with the public out here (in Indiana) is that they are ignoring social distancing and doing whatever they want without wearing masks of even bothering to keep a proper distance from others. I’ve been cussed out by people who have gotten too close when I asked them to observe the six foot distance.

It’s not that I want to hide away forever. I don’t! But I don’t think it’s safe enough yet — we have not met the CDC guidelines here in Indiana, and what with some of the videos I’ve seen from Memorial Day (one of said videos less than an hour from my location), I want to wait it out a little bit longer before venturing out into the world, because I would much rather be safe than sorry.

The parental figures are telling me that I am being crazy, that I need professional help, that I need to get away from the news and go out and live my life, that this is all just an excuse that I am making so I don’t have to work. I want to do what they want — but I don’t really feel like risking mine and my daughter’s lives to do so, especially when so many scientists and medical professionals are still urging caution. I want to give them time to develop therapeutics and such so if me or my daughter DO catch it, we will have a better chance of survival.

So am I crazy for still not trusting that things are going to be okay just yet?",2020-05-28 21:14:34

She resents me for having mental illnesses and is having a hard time abiding by 'household rules' that make me feel safe during this global pandemic (such as, ordering groceries instead of going to grocery stores, not getting take-out food, no hanging out with friends, no getting hair/nails done, etc). 

She thinks that my fears are beyond 'normal' (hint hint, they are, I fucking have OCD), and throws my mental illness in my face every time she doesn't get her way.

I was able to go out with the girlfriend and do lots of fun things together. Lately I just haven't been finding much joy in things at all. I am still happy and grateful for the family, friends and the girlfriend that I do have, but this social distancing thing makes it all look pointless aside from phone calling, texting and or video chat. It's just not the same at face to face human interaction and being able to go out to do things with them. Sure there are still some minor things you can do like pick up food, walk around outside, and visit people in your car. It just doesn't feel the same anymore and it honestly hurts to see people and feel like you can't even interact with them because of the virus. If you sneeze in public (allergy season) people will freak out and give you looks. You can't go to the bar and eat food and enjoy company with a bunch of strangers and the bartenders. You can't host or go to a family or friend's party. You can't go to the mall with a few friends. There is just so many things you can't do now and I just don't know if I can take the ""new normal"" if this is going to be the new normal.",2020-05-26 22:27:38

I still get that you can be a carrier though and still have the virus without having symptoms, but would a table be enough to separate people?

617,Working from home is giving me severe anxiety and depression,24,grajwk,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/grajwk/working_from_home_is_giving_me_severe_anxiety_and/,5,"I'm just needing to vent a moment, please bare with me.

So I work a job that is very stressful on the most normal of days - I do customer service via e-mail and phone support for a company that deals with the transportation of parcels. As is probably well known right now, everyone is buying things online and package volumes are higher than even during Christmas time. It's causing severe stress to an already stressful job, and the senders of these packages are oftentimes business owners. Because they're stressed due to the delay of packages thanks to COVID, they end up taking their frustration out on us. The word for today's post is 'stress' clearly.

Back in March, us CSRs were instructed to work from home and we have been ever since. While some people celebrate being able to WFH, I found that as someone with pre-existing anxiety and depression, the cler separation from work and home for me was needed to maintain my mental health. As I began working from home, it only took a few weeks for my anxiety and depression to become out of control - my apartment is extremely tiny, and I share it with my partner and cat. I unfortunately do not have a room I can lock myself in, so my cat ends up distracting me severely as she is quite needy and it messes with my productivity. Furthermore, because I take phone calls all day for my job, I've been told that my WFH arrangement also stresses out my partner as my headset can pick up the slightest noise and he can't behave like he normally does, needing to be quiet. So this arrangement doesn't only affect me but my family.

In a fit of desperation, I spoke to my doctor and she has prescribed me Prozac, which I actually seem to be acclimating to fairly well. However, the side-effects are a bit gnarly and that, along with everything else, is affecting my productivity. 

Working from home with my job has added a whole layer of complexity that is making me burnout and have breakdowns and depresive episodes in ways I never did when I was in the office. All I want to do is quit my job as I have enough for 3 months worth of bills saved up, but I know it might not be smart as who knows what the job market will look like in the future because of COVID.

Overall, my living situation (and myself) isn't suited for WFH, but my employer is giving me no other choice but to do this. For right now, we have no idea when we'll be back in the office, and that uncertainty is killing me even more. But I know if I quit, I won't get any ongoing unemployment benefits and my money will be gone in three months. My partner has already lost his job because of COVID, and is getting unemployment benefits but they are less than what he was making at his last job.

I am at a loss on what to do. My rational mind says it isn't smart to quit with only 3 months worth of savings under my belt, but I am suffering so tremendously that I'm not sure how long I ccan go on before having a full-on mental breakdown.",2020-05-27 05:56:17

I know that I have it better than many other people right now and I'm grateful for that, but I can't help but miss my friends, hugging people, going to people's houses, going to class. I'm fine with giving that up right now, but I wish we had a definitive end date even though that's pretty much impossible. There's no way of really knowing when we'll have a vaccine or good test and trace programs. I have no idea when my hospital volunteering program will start, I don't know when I can try and join a research lab, I don't know when I can start working again.

I am strong, I am a very strong person, of those who never need to vent. But right now, it’s not working.

I have the privilege of being able to choose to be quarantined in a country that is not quarantined. In my city basically everything will open this Monday. And due to some legal issues, I am being forced to leave my house several times during the last month, and I will have to continue to leave in future. It is desperate to see that all the shops are open, that the streets are crowded, that half of the people are without masks and the other half are just covering their mouths.

Here people are totally fond of viruses! Covid 19 is a communist thing!  Whoever quarantines is a lazy tramp who don't want to work! Honestly, I don't like to see anything in Portuguese these days to get away from these things.

Honestly, don't compare Brazil with the USA. Here's much, much, much worse.

I am currently my mother's caregiver, who is functional, but feels a lot of pain that prevents her from doing several things. She was a nurse and knows very well how to prevent illnesses, also taught me since I was a child how to clean things. But it seems that now my only function is to stop bad influences to come close to her. Most of her friends and relatives are also health professionals, who are trying to get her out of the house. Telling her to be more positive! People who are living normally!

I had to put up with her saying that due to all the contamination she lived in life, that she was immune to covid 19. Thankfully she realized the bullshit she said after a short time.

I would say that sanity has been gone for a long time.",2020-05-27 03:27:16

The depression came back at full force, I considered ending my life recently, I didn’t even realize my mental health got that bad again. It’s just so much at once and it’s been hard for me to take. I wish I could hug someone. I know this is all temporary, but I feel like the best part of my life is over and it’s all going downhill from there. I’m sorry if this sounds whiny or ungrateful.

At the moment we are deep cleaning the property and they've implemented many safety protocols including masking wearing by all team members as well as encouraging social distancing. They also check our temperature every morning which is kind of pointless since you can have the virus and not have a fever.

I guess it's time to ignore my fears and hope for the best. I was truly hoping they would have remained closed for at least another month as the governor had suggested but I guess they didn't think it was the best idea for the company.

The warehouse somehow remained open during all the shutdowns even though they are the epitome of non-essential.

I have been lucky enough to work from home since mid-March with the help of a doctor note stating that I should only be working from home due to my health issues.  I am able to do 90% of my job from home other then being onsite to replace a piece of hardware if it fails.

My letter will last me another month but my work is trying to force me back in the building.  They are threatening a furlough with the possibility of not bringing me back on at the end of it.

I am the only income in my family and I am supporting my wife and child so the thought of losing my job is scary but so is the possibility of losing my life.

From talking to my friends that are not able to work from home in the building they are planning mass hiring in July getting ready for our busy season.

I'm mainly worried about how the schools reopen. We haven't been told how schools are going to reopen aside from them reopening in September, we don't know how (or if) they are going to social distance, enforce face masks, how children at risk will be treated, any of it, and I don't know how to contact them to ask. Now, for the average kid, schools reopening will be fine. But this is a personal anecdote. So don't take this as me saying that reopening them is dangerous for everyone.

Alright, so. I have asthma, if I get it I'll probably at minimal be in intense agony and at worst be in a coffin. My mother has asthma, is in her 40s and is also quite obese. If she gets it I'm certain she will die or at least the virus will have a lasting impact on her body. We live in the same, stuffy, generally unhealthy house. We don't have a car and she's too lazy to walk usually so we have our grandmother drive us to the grocery shops. She's in her 60s and has high blood pressure that she is currently taking medication for. If she gets it, it'll fuck her up at least. My grandmother is also the only one interacting with and getting groceries for my great grandmother. She's in her 80s, self explanatory there.

Overall, me getting it sets off a domino effect leaving 3 people dead and me an orphan having to be taken in by one of my aunts that I don't really know all that well if they even have the room to fit me at all, and the most likely place I'd get it is in my cramped, small and 100+ pupil school. 

Most of the kids there are relatively healthy. If they get it they'll probably be asymptomatic or only have slight symptoms. The locker areas especially are very cramped, even if you decrease social distancing guidelines to 1m instead of 2m it'd be virtually impossible, provided that they even attempt to keep to the guidelines, considering that even 1m distancing would cover near half the corridor where a lot of other classes are also lining up to go into their classrooms, let alone 2m distancing.

So, in closing, am I fucked? I don't really see any reason to be not anxious about it. Even if transmission rates between children and parents are low there's still the chance of it especially considering me and my mother and grandmother are in close contact a lot. And, while I don't know the transmission rates for child to child, I doubt it's all that promising.",2020-05-27 06:00:44

The AC tech who came in to check if we could mount the light didn't wear a mask when he did (I was in the back of the store, so I never saw him).   


I'm concerned that he won't wear one again and that he could spread the virus into the AC system while he's working on it. He's going to be near the system for more than 15 minutes I imagine, working on it. I'm wearing a cloth mask, so that's barely any filtering for a viral load in the air in a building, I believe.   


My boss thinks that the light will start working and disinfect the air after it's plugged in. He also suggested that I wait outside until the AC guy is done if it would make me more comfortable. Even with that, I'm concerned that the virus could still be in the system after he leaves, that maybe got past the UVC light (which isn't guaranteed to kill 100% of viruses/bacteria anyway, from what I've read).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19\_support/comments/gpztvy/weekly\_good\_news\_sticky\_2531\_may\_2020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gpztvy/weekly_good_news_sticky_2531_may_2020/)

It has to go away because we can only sticky two posts at a time and we need to let you know about some new rules.

**THE NEW RULES - Offer support, not opinions**

**ANYONE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO JOIN 'END LOCKDOWN' PROTESTS, RIOTS OR OTHER CIVIL ACTION ON THIS SUBREDDIT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY BANNED.** 

Over the last couple of weeks, some discussions on this sub have started to get political and sometimes heated. There is a broad spread of people here - as there are in real life - who sit somewhere along a spectrum of risk-taking behaviour. But rather than being evenly distributed along that spectrum, there seems to be a tendency to cluster towards one end or the other. Those at both extremes seem to be offering their opinions to posters who didn't ask for them and starting arguments which seem to be more about getting their views across than offering helpful advice. It has to stop. It is not fair on the vast majority of users here who want support and advice for specific situations and contexts.

From now on, we will be removing posts that are not asking for emotional support and advice for specific situations (or offering resources to help people with the current situation) and any replies that do not address the OP's primary concern. For example, if an OP is worried because their nextdoor neighbour had a BBQ and two of the guests passed within a metre of an open window the OP was standing behind, help them to understand how likely it is they were infected - do not give an opinion that it's high time BBQs were allowed again or that their neighbour is a selfish asshole who is going to kill people. If an OP is worried because their cafe business is going bankrupt, offer them advice on where they can find help with financial management or anxiety attacks, don't tell them they're selfish to have wanted to keep the cafe open or that the people who won't let them open up are selfish for causing so much anxiety and bankruptcy. Just try to help them with their current situation.

It is extremely important, for everyone's mental and physical health that we do not polarise, politicise and and misrepresent this situation. We will all get through this by keeping firmly to the middle ground: not extremes.

The lockdowns HAVE been necessary. They HAVE saved countless lives across the world. Many people DO find them difficult, emotionally and financially and DO wish they were over. The most extreme lockdowns are now being eased, slowly and cautiously across most countries - see the stories I have been posting every week in the Good News sticky of (mostly European) countries starting to open up and go back to something more like normal. In the last two weeks, for example, the UK (where I am) has eased some lockdown restrictions so that more people have been able to go back to work, are able to meet up with friends and relatives in open spaces such as parks, visit beaches and outdoor beauty spots and play sports such as tennis, golf and basketball outdoors. Next week, schools reopen for some pupils and, if this proves to be as safe as it is expected to be, more will go back during the next three week period, when some non-essential shops will also reopen. Lockdown will not last forever. Nor is it right to end all lockdown restrictions tomorrow.

The leisure industry and tourism industries will reopen. But these plans have to go slowly. Rushing things, and causing a second spike that leaves hospitals overwhelmed again will only lead to more deaths. Italy, which has one of the world's highest case fatality rates, is thought to have been hit so badly because it was caught unawares and many people died because hospital capacity was overwhelmed. Countries that have been affected later have the opportunity to learn lessons and keep more of their populations alive.

Please avoid extreme opinions and views and keep them off this sub.

NO ONE on this sub should say that going for a jog or a run is killing people.

NO ONE on this sub should imply that it is easy for people to stay at home for three months without income, hugs or social interaction.

NO ONE on this sub should claim that suicides during lockdown are killing more people than COVID19 would kill if we just ended them tomorrow.

The reality lies in a reasonable and rational middle ground where some measure of restrictions on daily life is necessary to save as many lives as possible with recognition that those restrictions are not easy, and do cause some people real issues - this sub exists to help them cope with those issues.

We cannot - and will not - have people on this sub pushing political narratives, in either direction.

This sub is for people's \*personal\* experiences and difficulties during the outbreak. Replies should help and support that person through their difficulties.

Please don't let it descend into politics and pushing particular (often political) agendas. We do not have time as moderators to constantly debunk BOTH over-extreme ends of a spectrum. Anyone who seems to be more interested in pushing their point of view, attacking other users for having a different one or bringing up policies/politics not directly related to the post will have their posts and comments removed. Persistent offenders risk being banned.

Please, enjoy the sub and be kind to one another.",2020-05-26 03:28:32

If you become sick, they will send an alert to anyone who was physically close to the person in recent days. Since I've been working the entire time in an essential industry, I was required by my employer to have this. I didn't mind. I have a phone and FB, so its not like my whereabouts and activities are a huge off-the-grid secret. 

Cue cousin asking me if I had the app. Strange, but okay. I said I did, we use it due to being essential at work, etc. 

I was then asked to delete all information related to the extended family. Remove all contacts, all phone numbers, all photos, and all social media connections related to the family and then I would be blocked. 

I laughed. It must be a joke, right? 

Nope. They were serious. They believed this app was the beginning of a dictatorship, that they were monitoring our 'every move' and seeing who I interacted with in my daily life (yeah because me going between home and work is definitely government-monitoring worthy), and that the app would use that information to strip them of their freedoms. 

I told my husband, who made some calls to the family. After a little while, he comes back and he is pissed. Tells me to just block and delete those idiots for now. So I spent over an hour going through my social media, blocking and removing everyone who had a problem with me having this 'dictatorship app'. I've been told to also stay away from them, their houses and our local coffee shop.

A few relatives called me as time went on, saying they weren't part of that nonsense. 

This is the stupidest thing ever. They all have social media and smart phones. Yet this is the app that is tracking their personal information... through my phone *hunting* their phones down and *spying* on them. 

Oh yeah that makes much more sense /s",2020-05-25 18:32:50

I posted this somewhere else but thought here would be better, I know it's not important in the grand scheme of things,  and I'm lucky to have a place to live and be healthy, but I just wanted to dump about how bummed I am, my road to get to college has been bumpy, after an extremely tough period in highschool and isolated online school due to a disability, I'll be a ""freshman"" transfer student in the fall even though I just turned 20 (in quarantine) - I left my first school after the first semester because of a lot of issues I won't get into. I got accepted to a large school I adore in my state for fall, and even though it's stupid, I know even if classes are in session things will be very different, from what I've heard from colleges already releasing plans in general they will try to limit students interacting with each other as much as possible, no dining halls, possibly no clubs, and some colleges considering making small ""family"" groups because they think isolating students to literally being around no one will be too much. I probably sound melodramatic but I left my last school in part because it was isolating,  I hate to repeat the experience. I know college isn't all about the social aspects, but it's lonely out here, ya know? I'd take a gap year but I did that out of highschool and I don't want to be 25 when I graduate, I already feel old. Plus being with my family even longer isn't a great option, and due to my visual disability my options are limited by accessibility issues. I took online classes this semester at my community college and was not a fan, though I'm grateful to have inadvertantly avoided Zoom University. IDK what the point of this was but I was wondering if anyone else is feeling a bit defeated about the future?  I haven't seen my best friend in three months and there's no end in sight, plus my family's small buisness has basically come to a stand still, who knows when I'll see my grandparents again, they have a bunch of comorbidities, things feel...ruined I guess?

If you're religious can you keep her in your prayers, her church was one of her biggest loves when she was active & she loves frogs. 

About Marg:

She's a lovely lady but barely talks anymore, she used to play piano and sing for her church. When she was younger she suffered from depression and tried to kill herself, I always thought she always covered up the scars on her wrists with loads of heavy bracelets and bangles she wore constantly. When me and my sisters used to visit her as kids her whole terrace house was kitted out like it was still the 70s, but every available surface was covered in ornamental frogs. She gave me a bottle of Calvin Klein Shock perfume once for a birthday gift (she's not always been the best at presents, sometimes you'd end up with things you know she'd had in a cupboard for years, so the perfume was like 10/10 present wise) and it's been my favourite ever since. She lost her husband Les a few years ago, I hope she's at peace with the idea of leaving us to go wherever he's gone.

This is my first CoViD-19 death, I'm scared my Nana (93) will catch it since they both live not very far from eachother. 

I've known a lot of people die this year just from natural circumstances and possibly from being young and reckless. Another person leaving is hitting hard and I bdon't really know what to say or how to process this healthily, but I'm trying.

My thoughts are with all of you and your loved ones, I hope we all make it through this and learn whatever lessons this may teach us.

Now I know people will say well then don't go out as much, but here is the thing there are jobs that will make you wear masks for 8 hour shifts. If you want to go see a movie that is 2 hours wearing a mask depending if the theaters will mandate you to wear one when your inside watching the movie. Shopping can easily be 30 minutes to an hour if you haven't been out of the house for a while and you need supplies. I don't know I just feel like your doing more harm to yourself wearing a mask.

She doesn't care as long as she can go back to feeling needed and important. 

My gf's oldest daughter stayed at her dad's house for a couple weeks before coming back here. Her dad's gf works with patients in a nursing home with multiple cases. They're all at a cook out at her grandparents right now. Yesterday they were at our neighbors with multiple other neighbors for a cookout/pool party. 

She's been doing this for weeks. I can't talk sense into her. I compared her to some of the idiots online. You know, the ""Coronavirus isn't dangerous; goes to cookout/event/etc; Coronavirus IS dangerous guys! I tested positive!"" type morons. She got all offended because she's ""nothing like those people."" 

I've lost all respect for her. She's putting her wants and desires before the health and safety of every single person around her. I honestly do not recognize her any more.

I've decided that if I'm going to be forced to be exposed, I may as well go back to work. I've got two jobs lined up. I'm getting some money and leaving. I can't be with someone I don't respect. I can't be with someone so weak and irresponsible.

Seeing others dealing with things and the creativity out there as we attempt to overcome something so difficult together has made me feel weirdly connected despite not being at all.

I tested positive on Thursday 21st and started developing symptoms the day after. When I got tested I didn't think I had it as no symptoms, but because I work in care and had been so exposed to positive cases we were advised to get ourselves tested.

As standard, it started with a dry cough and progressed to a fever and body aches. Symptoms are managed with paracetamol but today I've found myself short of breath and doing the smallest task exhausts me and I have to sit down. I'm not too worried about myself, I'm young and relatively healthy, I'm more concerned about my parents who are obviously older. My dad also has high blood pressure.

[https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

If you scroll down the page to the first infographic, it gives a nice illustration of not only how well virtually every country has flattened the curve, but how many are now well on the downward slope, including some such as Denmark, Switzerland and Romania which have nearly reached zero new cases. 

Another useful page on the site is this one: [https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid](https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid) which shows that while the number of global recorded cases is still rising, the number of deaths is not rising anywhere near as steeply - the more we know about the virus, the more chance people have of surviving it. 

Finally, there's a slide pack of all the key slides with clear explanations here: [https://slides.ourworldindata.org/2020\_pandemic/2020\_pandemic#/25](https://slides.ourworldindata.org/2020_pandemic/2020_pandemic#/25) which shows that, taken as a whole, the global situation is trending downwards. Things are coming under control. 

Our World in Data is great for data visualisations on basically anything you might be interested in, as well as just COVID19, too!

For more general good news - lots of stories from the BBC about how lockdown has been giving us all a chance to reconnect with nature [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-52647258](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-52647258), which will be good for the planet as well as our own health if we can keep it up.

For those of us who've been taking advantage of this (I certainly have been!), garden centres are now reopening in the UK so that we can revitalise our gardens with our newfound fondness for all things green and flowery: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-52660034](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-52660034)

I hope there are similar stories of a return to normality from your countries. For those of you in places which are still slightly behind the curve... hang in there, it will get better. 

How about a call for photos of your favourites views as this week's good news theme? Particularly a special scene or beauty spot you didn't previously know was there, or a flowerbed you've had time to give tender loving care to outside your window?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm terrified of making this post as if somehow doing so will magically notify my landlord and everything will spiral out of control, i know its irrational but i've been having anxiety attacks that are threatening to go full panic attack just talking about it, so apologies if i'm being circuitous or vague. Even now I feel like by posting on here and not telling them I'm doing something wrong or even illegal? that's nonsense, right?

here's the background: i like my apartment and especially its location, but moreover, even in non-pandemic times, i dont have the funds or mental reserves to deal with moving. i have never had issue to call maintenance in before and ive been here a over two years (though ive had them in twice for downstairs issues - both times found nothing). It is a very very tiny studio apartment, with the only doors being the front door and the bathroom door, but the bathroom is so tiny that you can barely just stand in it with the door closed. Not a problem, generally, but relevant.

I live alone. The only person I have in the entire city to really call on is my brother, and I generally feel bad asking things from him. He's not been as strict about social distancing as me, though he has been trying, and we haven't seen each other in person since this started, apart from him picking up a package from six feet away early on. He also lives with a roommate and doesn't have anywhere for me to stay at his place.

I also do not drive, so with avoiding public transport, i'm pretty limited these days. Funds are naturally tight, but not so much that I have trouble with rent yet, thankfully.

I am at elevated risk and have been taking this very seriously because of that.

Okay so to get to the point. A little bit ago, I moved my bathmat and there was dampness under it. I figured it was just from water getting under it - the bathroom is so small you can't wash your hands without getting water on the floor. But then I noticed that a few of the floorboards were... a little squishy when stepped on? and if you push really hard a little tiny bit of water seeps up. The water doesn't smell of anything other than maybe faintly epoxy? The boards are a fake wood, vinyl or linoleum, and are glued down firm. 

At first I thought maybe water just seeped in, again, tiny bathroom - they aren't sealed tight or anything. But it kept happening. I can't tell if its getting worse or not, i've been in a panic about it since so everything's kind of hard to keep track of. It's noticeable now that the bathmat is off, but hard to say from before? Also I'm kind of obsessively looking, and I wasn't before.

It is not currently impacting my ability to do anything, other than the panic, and i have no idea how long its been going on for, it now occurs to me that the last bath matt i had to replace months back might have been from this too. I live on the top floor, and so if it were going through the floor, I assume the person downstairs would let them know? (I don't really interact with her at all, other than the one time she got mad at me for making noise just walking around late so...)

I know any water is a huge issue, but I have also had really bad experiences in past apartments where maintenance fixes made things way worse. My landlord (a big rental management company with not the best reputation in the city) sent an email out in march saying only emergencies. water leaks were included, technically?

I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should let them know, because if I do I lose all control. I have no reason to think they'd be particularly careful or sympathetic. If it takes more than a day to deal with and I'm without a bathroom, I have nowhere to go. I have really really bad anxiety about maintenance issues from previous bad experiences and just general anxiety problems already as well, but in the pandemic its even worse. To the point where I sometimes have panic attacks when maintenance is involved and need someone else to help deal with it. It's really embarrassing. 

So I haven't told them. Because I have nowhere to go, safely or otherwise. And i really don't want maintenance and whatever other contractors coming in and out of my apartment. There's also the matter of them probably having to go into the apartment below mine and that doesn't seem fair to her, either. I don't know her situation, health wise. But again, asking means essentially giving up control to maintenance to do whatever.

In better times, I may have embarrassed myself begging them to give me a time ppl were coming so I don't have a panic attack in front of their maintenance, and could ask my brother to come over and help me just. interface without in case my panic gets so bad i can't like. communicate. (it's happened before). But it's not better times. 

So I don't know what to do. You'd think nothing, right? But water can be serious and this could last for a year. Right now things aren't terrible in my city, but that's not a certainty and it could change at any time, too. I'm sort of losing my mind over this. Hence the long and rambly post. I don't even know what the TL; DR would be.

Thank you for reading, and really any advice would be welcome. What would you do in this situation?",2020-05-25 00:15:13

I am a 27 F living in Berlin, I am from Portugal and my whole family still lives there. I have moved to Berlin a bit over a year ago and visited them relatively regularly (3 times during that year and the plan would be to maintain a similar frequency). I deal well with homesickness most of the time, and it did not even cross my mind at the beginning of lockdown to go back home (like some of my expat friends did).

However, shortly after lockdown my paternal grandmother passed away (not Covid-19 related, as far as we know, but it was extremely sudden, despite her old age). My father was devastated, because of how sudden it was and because she was not allowed any visitors. In the beginning of this year, my maternal grandfather had a heart attack. He survived, miraculously, but a few weeks ago he was admitted to the hospital again due to complications of said heart attack. Last week, on my birthday, he ended up passing away. My grandmother, his wife, was the one visitor allowed inside once, on Monday, to say goodbye. Me and my maternal grandparents are particularly close, and I never imagined my grandmother having to go through this without me being there to hug her through it. I have quite some savings (thankfully) and moving to Germany was a decision I made on the assumption that if anything like this were to happen I would be able to pay whatever amount was needed to fly back to be with my family for some days.

I am working from home with a decent contract right now, and with a very reasonable employer. So it could be possible to work something out with them that would allow me to fly home. But at the same time, I would be too scared to even see my grandmother before spending two weeks in quarantine, and I do not even have anywhere I could isolate from my parents for two weeks. My heart is hurting so badly and telling me to book the first ticket home, but my head is fighting it and telling me the most responsible thing is to stay where I am. Am I overthinking it? I am experiencing so much pain right now and I am at loss on how to handle it, because I know the only thing that could make it better would be to spend some time with my family. But the last thing I want is to put them at risk.",2020-05-24 20:28:40

666,Irrational irritability towards those who just won’t wear a mask in public,113,gp9jnp,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gp9jnp/irrational_irritability_towards_those_who_just/,54,"I just need to rant here for a second. And I don’t mean to offend anyone personally. We all have free will to make our own decisions and I’m trying really hard to keep that in mind. 


So today I went to the pharmacy to pick up some medications. Thankfully, our pharmacy has a curb-side pickup option so that I don’t have to go inside. I’m waiting for the pharmacy tech to come out when a guy in a truck pulls up next to me, and there’s another guy in the passenger seat. Neither are wearing masks. The tech comes to my window and hands me my medications. Before I can roll the window back up, the guy in the passenger seat in the truck right next to me starts asking the tech questions, without a mask on. We’re maybe 2-3 ft apart at most. I get my window up as quickly as I can, but still. 


Now, I can admit that I’ve been very paranoid about COVID-19. Honestly, I would prefer to not interact with any other human besides my fiancé (whom I live with) for a long time until the pandemic subsides. So going out and interacting with other people right now is a huge trigger for me and my anxiety. 


The guy from the truck looked pretty healthy and I’m trying not to assume, but I honestly couldn’t see why he wouldn’t be wearing a mask while interacting with the public. It freaks me out and now my brain won’t shut up with anxiety about the chances of him possibly spreading the virus to me or the tech. 


I also couldn’t help but note how many people were going in and out of the store and pharmacy without masks on. How are people not scared? How can people just function without applying any caution at this time? The death tolls, the complications seen in like 20% of people getting sick, healthy people having extreme reactions and getting seriously ill from this all have me freaked out on a regular basis. How have these individuals ignored this? I honestly don’t get it.",2020-05-23 22:06:58

I am in serious need of advice. I will make every effort to stick to facts to put as little bias into this as possible as I am having a very difficult time remaining objective and separating my feelings from the situation I find myself in.

I work in support of the food and pharmaceutical industry maintaining and certifying equipment that is used to ensure items being produced are free of contaminants. Issues with the equipment I work on can stop production lines entirely which now more than ever is problematic.

My work requires extensive travel across state lines, staying in hotels etc. I have been working away from home for the past two and a half weeks. I have lived with my fiance and her daughter for the past 2 years. Prior to my leaving we discussed precautions I would take. The plan was for me to come home unless I had cause to believe I might have been exposed.

About a week ago, my fiance expressed concerns about the places I was travelling to and the risk of exposure. She asked me to not come home unless I could self isolate for two weeks. This is for all intents and purposes impossible with my job schedule. I simply will not have a window of time where I can make that happen.

They both have health issues. Endometriosis being the primary and both tend to get sick more easily than most.

In respect of this I have taken every precaution I can think of. I have only traveled by car. I disinfect all surfaces in the hotels I stay at before even unpacking. I have not eaten out, only going to grocery stores in more rural areas, during off peak hours to buy items I can prepare in the hotel rooms. I wear a mask in public, use disposable gloves to pump gas. Only gas up my vehicle outside of metro areas. 

The nature of my work requires screening prior to entering facilities. All of the facilities require that I wear full PPE. Mask, gloves disposable outerwear etc. and social distancing is strictly enforced. At jobs I had interactions with about 12 people total. Other than gas and a weekly trip for groceries, I only go hotels and job sites.

Travel was in Twin Falls, ID, WA including Seattle, Yakima, Chehalis, Ontario, OR and Salt Lake City, UT. I live in rural CO.

They both work from home. They do not have health insurance. They run online businesses that have only recently started to perform well.

They are terrified of becoming infected. Both for long term implications from potential medical costs and for how it could impact their recent success in business.

For my part, I feel as if I am being forced into limbo. Can't go home without causing serious upset. The isolation of spending potentially months in hotels. The extra expense for hotels for any stay not related to a job. Feeling like I no longer have a home. Feeling unwanted...

I feel incredibly torn. I respect and love them. I am having a hard time disentangling my feelings from this and being objective. I feel that with the precautions I am taking that the risk of them contracting the virus is very low. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is any increased risk no matter how small unacceptable? Is what they are asking excessive? We've been unable to reach an understanding on the subject. Is it selfish of me to want to be able to go home? My emotions over this are a mess.

I've taken a lot of your advice and have been trying to implement new habits, and I've spoken to my girlfriend and family about the situation.

I'm sorry if I didn't respond to everyone immediately, I took a break from social media to relax for a while also. And finally, people here have expressed that they like my writing and should continue to do so. I was very flattered by this, and decided that if I write something about my experiences that I'm confident in sharing, I'll consider sharing it in the future. Have a good dayeveryone, and thank you for all the amazing support :). I'll be leaving the rest of this post up in case anyone else wants to read it. 

I would like to start this post by saying that I understand that the virus is affecting millions of people worldwide, and many of these people have become sick and/or died as a result of this virus or comorbidities that were exacerbated by the virus. It is not my intention to disregard this fact in this post, I'm genuinely looking for advice or support on this subreddit. Again, I don't intend to break isolation and expose people recklessly, or disregard the many individuals impacted by this pandemic. 

 For some background I work on an inter facility transport ambulance, I won't say where. Most of my job these day's revolves around transporting COVID positive patients between facilities in order to keep them isolated from the general public. This means I visit the many hotspots around my county, from Nursing Facilties, private residences, ICU's, Emergency Rooms, or other specialty facilities. On top of this in order to protect my family and friends I've self isolated in an RV, as it was my only option. I've started this isolation since roughly March 12, when things began to get shut down around my country. I live in a shitty area where people set fireworks off at night, theres a car chase or major crime that happens at least once ever 2 weeks, and I live right on the edge of a canyon which means I frequently get to hear the local junkies have their fun at night nearby. 

Anyways, to get to the point of this post. The title of this post captures everything I've been experiencing emotionally the past two weeks. I think I've reached a point where I don't care if I get sick anymore, and if I catch it and die I'm kind of chill with it all. I've seriously tried to stay optimistic about the whole situation and give a shit, but at this point I'm over it. Transporting COVID patients is so fucking draining. A COVID call goes like this. First, we suit up in our PPE. Our PPE is actually quite good compared to some places because we've improvised a bit, which consists of a used N95, surgical mask, two pairs of gloves, a pair of glasses, faceshield, and a raincoat as a gown. In this regard we're lucky, but wearing it sucks. After 10 seconds of wearing your PPE in 90 degree weather you begin sweating balls. The raincoat traps your sweat, which then evaporates from the heat, and then repeats this process until you have your own personal sauna. The face shield and glasses then fog up so you can hardly see, and your N95 and surgical mask is so difficult to breathe through I've heard coworkers complain of feeling dizzy. You're a minute in to this call. You stay this way for an hour. Go into the facility, you're generally greeted by outdated policies from some staff with complaints about whatever bull shit they wanna complain about. Pick up your patient, which is generally asymptomatic and ok. Sometimes they aren't, like the guy I found in respiratory failure. While trying to treat him I couldn't even see his face through my PPE, and it was so hot when a piece of my gown slipped I dripped sweat from my arm on to his shirt collar. Whoops. Also, your rig is from the 90's and doesn't have AC, have fun!! And the vent used to expel air particles is so loud you can't hear anything else, so not only can you hardly see or breathe, you can hardly hear over the constant WWHIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRR of the vent. Bring the patient to whatever place hes going to while trying to stay sane and safe, drop him off while dealing with staff again, and then deep clean your rig for the 4th time that day. While cleaning you try to remember everything you touched, everything they touched, anything they coughed on, etc. At a certain point you begin to care less, until you begin to think of stuff like ""if I lick the bench seat maybe it could just be over with and I'll either have immunity or be dead"". You finally doff your PPE, and you look and feel like you ran a marathon. Sweat all over, literally dripping off you, you turn to notice a lady eyeing you suspiciously at the bus stop. ""Yup, I'm fuckin infected. Now quit looking at me."" Then the tablet rings, notifying you of your 5th COVID call that day. You're 6 hours into your 12 hour shift. 

Anyways, doing this 4 days a week has left me exhausted. On top of this my family keeps telling me bull shit like ""stay cautious!!"" or keeps telling me about all these COVID facts over the phone. I love them, but its driving me crazy cause they have no idea about what's going on in real life. Theres only so  cautious I can be when I go to a patients house and have to break in through the window, because I can see him face down on the floor when I peak through his curtains. ""Welp, looks like I'm breaking into a house for the first time, better be fuckin cautious!"". I just can't be cautious to the level they expect me to be, its humanly impossible not to slip up. I've been living alone, eating terribly, I'm exhausted, I'm constantly reminded of it by my family on my off time, I can hardly see my girlfriend or friends, and half my week I'm speaking to the people or treating the people who have it. I'm sick of it all, I don't care anymore. Let me get it already, even though I probably already do. I wanna sleep in my bed, my actual bed, in an actual home, in a home where the toilet has water in the bowl and flushes without assistance, where the bathtub doesn't overflow after a week of showers, and I can use wifi liberally for my youtube subs. I wanna stop being treated like the plague by loved ones and strangers, and I want to be left alone by the weirdos who feel the need to thank me for shit they'll forget about when it blows over. I want to be able to run calls that I don't feel mentally and physically exhausted after by default. I don't want to be bitched at by staff at a facility because they ran out of gowns on the behalf of their management forcing them to use them for stupid reasons. I want to be less tired. Stop going out strangers, stay inside, and to the people staying inside: calm down a little bit. 

I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired. I don't care anymore. But I care enough to do my job, and treat my patients well. So that's nice.",2020-05-23 10:08:17

At the beginning of the Corona pandemic my husband (married for two years, together for about 12) became ill. At first we were worried he had COVID-19 but luckily it turned out to be just a strep throat. However... it didn't go away, also not after two courses of antibiotics. (in the end it took 6 courses of antibiotics!)

Then, on a Friday night two months ago, he fainted when going to the loo. I didn't find him till hours later in a puddle of blood. He hit his head and was very confused. The ambulance came and took him to the hospital where they x-rayed him and concluded a mild concussion and a broken collar bone.

I was relieved to have him back home after that, but two days later his other arm (not the side of the broken collar bone) started swelling up. He went back to the GP and then got referred for a scan and turned out to have both thrombosis and infection in the arm. But on the scan they saw more, unfortunately.  His lungs had spots in them. So they did another scan, this time a PET scan with radioactive fluid and a puncture of the tissue.

When the results came back it was like the world fell apart, he turned out to have final stage lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) which has metastasized to his adrenal glands and neck lymph nodes. The doctor estimates he has between 6 weeks and a year left.

It's hard to deal with that news at any time of course, but right now it's extra difficult. I continuously fear he gets Corona. He has ADHD and autism and forgets to keep distance or to wash his hands. I don't blame him, he really does try, but it keeps me awake at night. He only barely survived that strep throat after 6 weeks of antibiotics.  Every time we go somewhere (we only go strictly necessary places like the hospital) I bring masks and gloves but I'm still so worried. He sometimes scratches his mustache under his mask etc. I do try to keep an eye on it, but it happens so quickly...

Also it's hard when seeking support. All I want to do is hug the kids, or hug our friends (and sometimes I need a hug myself as well!)  but I can't.  I'm so sad over it all. I'm losing my husband, my best friend, and my inspiration...and there's nothing I can do and I can't even comfort the kids and other people who are sad about it.

And then there are people who get on my nerves. You probably seen the type: ""Corona is just a flu"" or even worse: ""Big pharma is out to get you with those vaccines they're developing"". I'm not saying every pharmaceutical company has their heart in the right place, but come on, these are the people that are trying to buy my husband some time.

My husband has got one family member in particular, he is into conspiracy theories. The guy can't really help himself and normally I know how to keep my cool, but he keeps on telling my husband how the chemo is bad for him. Also, he says he should eat vegetables only (and just of a certain ph value as well). Tonight I totally lost it. After my husband stating ten times he benefits from the chemo I got so angry I got the phone out of his hands, hung up after yelling at the guy that he has treated exactly zero patients and my husband's doctor has treated thousands. Just before I hung up I heard him say ""but I did research"". After that I cried and cried and hit a hole in the garden table.(And feel ashamed for doing so)

I feel so angry and sad. I just don't know how to deal with it all.

Adding a picture of my husband waiting in hospital this week for the results of blood tests. In two weeks time he gets another scan to see how the cancer is doing.

So sorry for the long and rambling post, I just had to get it off my chest.

I want to retrain in order to assist with solving the current pandemic, as well as the many more we are likely to see with the combination of overpopulation, travel, and climate change. My goal for this post is to get help determining where my assistance could be most useful.

With my masters of science in acupuncture and associate in nursing degrees, I have a strong rudimentary understanding of the basic sciences. I'm not opposed to going back to school if that's what it takes. Which fields are in most need right now? And, which levels of education are needed currently, and projected to be needed in the future?",2020-05-23 18:38:13
674,My experience as a suspected (negative) covid case in Ireland and nearly dying due to not calling the doctors soon enough,12,gp41hv,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gp41hv/my_experience_as_a_suspected_negative_covid_case/,10,"I am originally from the NYC area but settled in Ireland a couple of years ago. A month ago I had pain in my right arm that I was 90% sure was a blood clot. I have two genetic mutations that both increase clotting and my brother got multiple pulmonary embolisms (blood clot breaks off and travels to the lung where it becomes extremely dangerous and can kill you if it makes it to the heart).

I ran the symptoms by my pharmacist because it was very hard to speak to my GP over the phone and I had an appointment coming up anyway. Well my GP office wasn't letting anyone in the building and passing prescriptions out through the hatch at the entrance. I should have kept pushing to contact a doctor by phone, but the pain resolved itself in 24 to 48 hours. So I made my first critical mistake and decided to wait and see if any symptoms returned or I got short of breath.

Four weeks passed, so I thought I was in the clear. Then one day I had severe shortness of breath causing me to gasp for air after a brief 5 minute walk and was panting for 20 minutes when I got home. I made my next mistake and decided to wait and see what happened the next day. I felt a lot better, but noticed I was getting out of breath from shorter walks than usual. It easily could have been attributed to being out of shape from lockdown, but the combination of the episode 4 weeks ago and the attack the previous day told me this is probably a blood clot.

I had not been ill, had no other symptoms of covid, my temperature was being taken every day and was always on the low side. However when I called my doctor's office, as soon as I said shortness of breath I was banned from coming near my GP office, booked for a covid test and a trip to the covid assessment centre. I don't drive so had to get a ride there the next day.

The covid assessment centre in Shannon was excellent, used proper PPE, checked my vitals and interviewed me, and agreed it was probably not covid but a pulmonary embolism (PE). I was referred to the hospital in Limerick however I had to go through the ""suspected covid route"" of the ER. This is where I began to lose faith in the protective measures of the health system.

I was put in a makeshift waiting room that was simply 4 chairs spaced a couple of metres apart in an unused hallway. I spent 10 hours in that chair, and the girl on the end seemed like she had covid. 2 days later she had deteriorated so rapidly I'm fairly certain she had covid. She was wheeled past me on a stretcher (within inches of me) as I left the bathroom. Eventually I was put in a single room in the covid area of the ER. Good. At least I have sealing double doors and am alone. 

However the doctors and nurses only had surgical masks (same as the public) and no proper PPE like they did at the assessment centre. The bathroom however was shared by everyone in the ward. It was meant to be cleaned between uses but never was. Id put my mask on, try to socially distance but it was too crowded to do so. Once I got to the bathroom it was dirty and one time there was blood in the toilet as well. You can imagine how many times I sanitised my hands, but that shared bathroom made me quite nervous. 

Another 8 hours or so passed before I got a blood test to check for clotting (a d dimer test that I was hoping my GP would do because it seemed quite obvious I didn't have covid) . However I understood the precaution. The blood test showed I did have a clot and I knew it was in my lungs due to the shortness of breath. I had to have a nasal and throat swab to do a PCR test for covid. They told me it would take 24 hours to get the results and only then could I get a CT scan of the lungs to locate the extent of the clotting. 30 hours passed, test came back negative, and I was moved to an ""overflow ward"" to get me out of ER. Now 2 to 3 days had passed between the time I called my doctor and the time I got the scan.

I was then cleared to move to the medical ward and await the results of my lung scan. Everyone in the hospital was now being swabbed for covid before being allowed into the wards. However covid patients could be on your ward in the next room and you wouldn't know. They are just quarantined in their room but on the same ward as non covid patients.

My scan results showed that not only were both lungs filled with ""many many clots"", the main issue was a massive clot in my pulmonary artery. If you imagine your heart having a Y shape with two arteries to each lung, the right branch connecting the heart and lung was nearly totally blocked. They delivered the news as if I had cancer. I was an inch away from either death or permanent heart and lung damage. They told me any later and I'd be dead or permanently damaged. Luckily they did extensive testing of the heart and lungs and saw no permanent damage.

I got very lucky. I was still alarmed by the fact the staff only had surgical masks and we couldn't socially distance. I shared a bathroom with my 4 roommates and none of us had covid, but I was less than impressed with infection control on the ward. Still I got the treatment I needed and about 10 days after I entered I was cleared for release. However the physiotherapist discovered that simply climbing one flight of stairs got my heart rate from 60 to 155. Not good. I live on a first floor apartment and have to climb one flight.

I am told my stamina will fully return but I should expect months before I'm fully recovered. I have to walk very slowly and not talk while I move about. I can't walk more than a minute or two. I get out of breath and slight chest pain from talking on the phone too long or long conversations and need to lay down. I'm learning to do everything slower.

I'm telling this story for two reasons:

1) even if you have no covid symptoms your treatment will be delayed while awaiting the test results, all surgery is postponed unless its ""life or limb"" and you're going to die immediately. If you have one symptom of covid then it's delayed further. So don't do what I did and wait until the last minute before contacting a doctor or going to the ER. Id be dead if I waited another day.

2) my fear of being in contact with potential covid patients was confirmed, but the fact that everyone is being tested on admission means you're pretty safe once you get to the appropriate ward. The medical care, the extent of testing, the doctors and nurses were all excellent. Better than the American hospitals id been to. PPE was lacking but the management of my condition was excellent and I was taken very good care of.

 I actually didn't mind staying in the room with 4 roommates for a week, because they were all really friendly and sociable elderly men. The socialisation and excellent food combined with great nursing made my stay extremely pleasant once I was in the medical ward.


To anyone working in the limerick hospital, I understand these are difficult times and a lot of the issues I mentioned are understandable. I don't blame the individual staff members, but the system in the covid route of the ER needs fixing and we need to get everyone working in that hospital actual PPE. I wanted to give a clear and honest account of what happened and how it felt. 

Also a huge thank you to all the staff in that hospital as they all contributed to saving my life. The nurses are fantastic, the doctors listen and explain better than in America, the quality of care was superior, I saw so many specialists and every complication was ruled out. Despite the chaos in the emergency ward, I really love every staff member I encountered there and want to say thank you from the...left side of my heart.

TLDR: Don't delay going to the doctor / hospital, because the hospital has to delay you longer than usual and I would be dead if I waited any longer.",2020-05-23 16:24:16

677,I don't think my mental health will ever be the same again because of COVID19 even if we do go back to normal.,27,govgyb,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/govgyb/i_dont_think_my_mental_health_will_ever_be_the/,5,"So I have noticed my mental health lately just isn't getting better. Even with everyone trying to reassure me that everything will be okay. I want to believe that it will and things will go toward the right direction with this whole pandemic. It's not even just the anxiety of how a pandemic caused the country to go into lockdown and in other places toke it a lot further it just makes it feel like things will never be safe again.

I feel like there is always a chance I can get it the moment I step out of the home. I don't get fear to the point where it's bad, but I definitely always feel uneasy whenever I go out now. Whether I am worried someone won't stay 6 feet either because someone isn't paying attention or it's coincidence I bump into them around a corner. I am anxious about touching things that what I am touching could have COVID19 on it. That's why my hands nowadays feels more dry than before because I have increased my hand washing like way more than double the usual amount that I hand washed before. 

Even if life does go back to normal I am anxious if we will get another pandemic that will cause this whole thing to happen again. Not only that but we have seen news reports over second waves that have been happening in other countries. Which then causes you to worry if the virus will really ever get down to the point where it's safe to go out again.

All these things go on in my head that this whole pandemic has really affected me in a mental way and not for the better. Before I never had anxiety over anything really. I was happy to go to work, see my girlfriend, see my friends, go to stores, malls etc. without fear of getting something that is really dangerous. Now you can either get something that can make you really sick or even die in the worst circumstance. Or you can get this horrible virus, not even know that you have it and severely impact people in your life or you pass it on to some random stranger. 

Don't get me wrong I know businesses are aware of it and I know that they will do what they can to make us safe. I just don't feel like I will ever be reassured to the point that everything will be okay and that I will always be fearful of this virus and that the pandemic has caused huge problems to our world.",2020-05-23 04:42:05

I was in the hospital for maybe 5 minutes tops while they rescheduled me but I was in the dentist room with the other patients for couple minutes while they assigned a new date (not close to any but still)

This is my first time posting and I am looking for someone to help me.  I have very bad anxiety which focuses on my health. I live in NYC, and I am a 46 year old female.

I had gotten to a point where I was handling the pandemic pretty well.  I stayed at home and only left my apartment to walk my dog, get some exercise and to grocery shop.

On Thursday, I went out with my dog as usual in the afternoon.  He got loose from his leash and ran across the street.  A man walking on the street, thankfully, caught him.  He then handed me my dog.  I was wearing a cloth mask but he wasn't.  I am now scared that I may have exposed myself to covid19.  I do not know this person -- consequently, I don't know if he has or doesn't have the virus.  Our interaction was less than a minute -- he didn't even speak.  But I have convinced myself that I have come into contact with the virus and consequently, I am in an anxiety/panic spiral, waiting for the symptoms to arrive.  I don't know how I will handle the next 2 weeks. I also feel very bad that instead of feeling grateful that this person saved my dog, I am assuming that he has the virus.

I would really appreciate if someone could help ease my mind. or change my way of thinking.

I had the worst headaches I've ever felt. No appetite and body aches, especially in my legs. Now I do have IBS and havent taken my meds in a while - but that diarrhea was so different. I use coal-pills to keep everything 'firm' down there to say it nicely. Usually it does help. In this case it absolutely didn't though.

I had some fever around the third day which passed quickly. No coughing, whatsoever. No chest pain as far as I can tell. I just sneezed alot and had a clogged nose, plus diarrhea, fatigue, muscle pain and general tiredness. It all passed within 4-5 days

The weird thing about this is that i already had a cold in november of 2019. I've never gotten two colds within this short time. And I've also never had a cold that didn't include coughing. The last cold I caught took me at least 2 weeks to fully recover from - this one only a few days. My parents also experienced wildy different symptoms. My mom for example was feverish alot of the time with an upset stomach and had, just like me, no coughing whatsoever.

I really really hope it was a very mild case of covid and I don't have to worry anymore about catching it. I will get tested for immunity soon. What do you guys think, was it a cold or covid?",2020-05-22 14:09:25

For context I work at a casino in California and a lot of our players and dealers travel back and forth from China frequently to visit family so I think my chances were a bit high. I got sick and had what I thought was the worst flu I’ve ever had, I felt extremely weak/fatigued. One day while home sick I took a nap and woke up drenched in sweat and full on convulsing. I went to urgent care the next day, they gave me both a strep test and a nose swab flu test both of which came back negative. As luck would have it a few days into being sick I developed tonsil stones which definitely complicated my original flu or whatever I had because coupled with the tonsil stones I couldn’t eat anything aside from soup, jello, and water for nearly 2 weeks. In my household my sister and her boyfriend both got whatever I had. My 4 year old nephew also got so sick he had to be hospitalized. Neither of my parents got sick which is interesting regardless of it was the flu or COVID considering one is 57 and the other is 60 each with underlying medical issues. 

Because of my situation being so specific I’ve been curious about taking an antibody test to determine if that’s what it actually was or not. I’m just curious if antibody tests are worth it at this point? Are they accurate enough? Do we know enough about antibodies yet to determine whether testing positive for them even means anything?",2020-05-22 12:34:04

At home, my parents and my sister are working from home because of the situation and I finished my college classes in April with no word on graduation yet. We buy groceries about every 10 days at least and it's usually done by someone who has something else to do outside so everyone isn't exposing themselves. Everything from the outside is washed/desinfected before going inside the house, we get out of our clothes as soon as possible, throw them in the washing machine and go shower after returning from somewhere. If family visits we stay apart, don't touch them and everyone is wearing masks (and gloves if they have something for us or viceversa). We are not ordering delivery food (my sister is scared of infected people making it) and the one time we did and when our family members gave us food we washed the outside or the packaging and reheated the food before eating it. 


Now cut to my friends, one of them told me they were hanging out with their neighbor (not even same building, the ""neighbor"" lives in the same street a couple of houses away) and even if they wore masks I don't get it, if we could hang out then why are we staying home?? 


Another instance was for a friends birthday, a few friends that have cars planned to visit him and that's okay but when I saw the pics they were out of the car and standing way closer than I would like. 


Then, a youtuber I watched said that they will not go out at all for two weeks and their parents too so they can see each other, but if things were like that why didn't people stock on food and everyone quarantine for 2 weeks and then no one has it right? No. Because people not showing signs and not knowing they had it is how all this happened in the first place. 


Also a lot of people in my country have an employee that cleans the house and cooks etc and usually they stay on the weekdays and go home on the weekends, we don't have that in my house but I was very surprised to find out that many people still have their employees in their home and they still go home on the weekends and come back! 


And the final straw is that I was browsing instagram and there was a post that said something along the lines of this is not over, stay home and when I opened the coments, people were saying that a virus shouln't stop their life, media blew it out of proportion, more people die from the flu and so on.  


And all of those things make me feel stressed, like I'm doing too much and overthinking about the magnitude of the situation. So, is it true? Is getting close to people and touching them okay? Is it safe to go out? Should we not be so fearful at my house?",2020-05-22 03:30:23

All my family is pressuring me to come, and they think I am being overly cautious. I still don't know if I'll go or not. Even if I don't, I'm just one person. I can't control other family members' decisions. So, I don't know, I just feel uncomfortable with the whole thing.

I had a cough that lasted about a week or so, then it hit me like a cold, but it was different. I felt slightly feverish. My typical fevers are that I cannot walk without my legs feeling weak/heavy and feeling slightly nauseous. I had that but it was very mild. I don’t have a thermometer so I didn’t know if I truly had a mild fever. My fiancé also caught what I got but he was more up and about than me, but had similar symptoms without a fever. Then we gave it to our roommate who felt like crap, but still walked around. To him it was a nasty cold.

I believe I caught it from a coworker who had a nasty cough for about a month and was out of work for a couple weeks.

My county didn’t have any positive cases until March but obviously there wasn’t really any testing kits until April/May.

I've felt extreme fatigue from stress and lack of sleep before before, but this feels more on the level of when I had a particularly bad case of bronchitis a few years ago, or am I just scared and thinking I feel worse than I do. I've been monitoring my temperature and my oxygen levels everything's normal. I should note here that I have bad a asthma that requires the use of a nebulizer and a long acting daily inhaler so regularly check on my oxygen and heart rate to make sure everything's looking good, that's just part of my daily routine.

Today is the day #49 of quarantine, considering the day that on my workplace they send us home (And for those we can, work from home). However, technically my state Jalisco started to close up schooles, events, etc. since March 17, while at a federal state was to start on March 23.

However, i had to evade social networks a lot, since there's a huge rise on sickening stuff. Medical staff being assaulted, one hospital closed their doors 'cause people assaulted it since ""the medics are killing their families"" (but they say the Covid is a lie). In resume, the ignorance is too damm high!

A lot of people say that coronavirus doesn't exist since they know no one with the dissiease. But when i exampled the failure on that thinking, that on that terms, for me the VIH, Nacrocartels and world hunger didn't  exists since i know no people with VIH, no ""sicarios"" and no friend of mine died from starvation, i was told that was ""the stupidiest thing"". Simply, people want to believe they are right, and everyone else is wrong, even when you put the probes on their eyes.

I'm feeling tired, not 'cause of isolation (i had been somewhat introvert, i don't have a lot of friends, less those ones that go to party 24/7). What is getting me tired, is the lack of respect to others, that want to impose THEIR ideas.

We had been taking turns in my home to get what we need, and attempting to maximize efficiency (For example, i have to go to my workplace physically so i get my paycheck, so i use that to also get food or medicine we might require. At least when i go out, i notice a lot of people actually use face masks, respect the ""Sana Distancia"" so places are less crowded, and so go on on stuff that talks about being a responsible person.

However, days ago my mother went to get seeds and that kind of food since our ""reserves"" where going low... and she was MAD. Really mad! She told us that people at that market aren't trained to keep distance, even some of them where eating the food on place! A lot of failures that speaks about defficient to null training. Nothing compared to the ""Fresko"" (Is something like Walmart), where they even have ""checkpoints"" inside for the fruits and vegetables sections, and they mentioned that each night they sanitize the whole store.

Today a lot of people on my city where manifesting that the state goverment isn't allowing to open their comerces, even taking measures. And i understand them somehow, the boss on our job pawned 2 job trucks and mortgaged his house to be able to pay another month of half wages, since the workplace money reserves got totally empty! However, the comments on that post where: ""they have trucks that price over 17,000 usd they aren't starving, sold them and they will eat for a year""... so yes, they are the kind of people that believe anyone who has a better lifestyle don't have rights 'cause they are not poor.

I'm tired that a lot of people is stupid. I understand that the reality is diferent for everyone, that we must know the context to understand... but there's a lot of people that don't want to test the other's shoes, they simply want to believe they know more than a doctor or a scientist 'cause they watched some video on youtube.

On the bright side, while i have somehow a ""low"" number of contacts and friends, almost over 95% of them are actually people that is concius and don't believe bullshit at random. Even those ones who ""minimize"" the pandemic, and believe isn't so bad, still use facemasks and follow recomendations, respecting all those that believe.

But is sad to see a huge number of ignorant and dumb people everywhere. And sadly, thats one of the reasons why we have a such bad president today. And sadly, now i can confirm that is 'cause this kind of people why México is still a poor nation with a low quality of life. I understand a lot better why people risk their lifes for a poor but better quality life in the USA.

But well, in theory, in 10 days most stuff will start to work again taking special health measures (Is that, or risk a nationwide civilan war, or at least that's what i belive could happen).

I've been lurking at subreddits like r/depression and r/self but then came across to this which would probably have more people that can relate to my situation given current events.

A bit of background information. I'm 28 years old, and a bit of a late bloomer graduating from college with my Bachelor's just last year. I had been in college on and off for 8 years due to lifelong depression and anxiety (I was diagnosed with ASD at a young age) that required me to take a part time load during most of my tenure, as well as working a part time job in retail that wore me off. 

The turning point of my life happened right around this time last year, graduating and getting a job in my field. This improved my self-esteem and gave me the confidence to socialize with people more, even going as far as going to conventions and mass gatherings that align with my interests and lifestyle. Meeting new friends that I desperately needed, as challenging as it was at first, cured my depression and I had been the happiest in easily more than 15 years.

Then bam. This pandemic had to happen and all my dreams had to be shattered. All my hopes of finally succeeding in life have gone away, and I've been rotting in my mom's house in self-isolation in the last two months. Which brings this to another goal I had - I had planned on finally moving out and starting my own life by the end of 2021 or 2022. I'm still employed, but who knows how much longer that lasts and I'll have to suffer even longer, because god forbid it takes months or even a year or two before I could land another decent job. Online chats are okay, but they're simply not the same and to be frank I've lost a lot of motivation to even keep tabs on people given this pandemic. 

I appreciate any input you guys could possibly provide, given that a lot of others seem to be in my shoes right now. I fear we'll be physically distancing ourselves, doing everything virtually, and wearing masks everywhere we go forever -- all of these only feed onto my depression and it hurts -- emotionally and physically. I want to see my friends again but it hurts that I can't even plan my future at all.",2020-05-21 04:40:40

For the sake of clarification, I feel like I need to give a tiny bit of background info, so here goes...
I have been happily married for 8 years to a wonderful and (usually) carefree husband. He is 11 years older than me and was born with a heart defect that makes him particularly vulnerable to any infection that might impact his heart. For example, if he gets the flu, or even a bad cold, or has to go to the dentist, his doctor prescribes him a course of very strong antibiotics just to prevent an infection that could lead to death. So the covid thing has us both being careful to the extreme.
We live in the U.S. and our state is pretty much completely opening this week and now I am more anxious than ever. 
Usually, my anchor are my friends. Please don't judge them as a whole on what I'm about to say but I do want to hear other's opinions because I feel lost.
My husband and I moved to another state from Florida about 2 years ago and most of our friends still live there. They are all wonderful and kind and helpful in every way but some of them are beginning to express annoyance towards my husband and my precautions.  For example, a few of our friends have asked to visit us and I had to turn them down.
My best friend moved to the same city as me a year ago (also from Florida) and is visibly annoyed and critical of our precautions. It hurts. And before you say to just ditch all those friends, they are sometimes the only connections I have to talk to.
A lot of my friends have sort of a yolo attitude haha and I love them for it, usually. But under these circumstances, I feel alienated, almost betrayed.  :/
I feel trapped and lonely.  I'm not sure I am asking more for advice or connections or both.
I don't  want to lose my friends but there are a few issues I am not willing to compromise on. 
This is a situation I have never found myself in. My husband would never ask me to choose between him and my friends. I would love some advice and guidance on how to navigate this situation or if anyone else is going through something similar...

I’ve been generally pretty active the last year (walking, light jogging), but I’ve only recently started to actively try and lose weight. 

I’m currently employed on the west coast in a region that has done very well at combatting the virus, but the company that I work for likeIy doesn’t have a future. I’ve been looking for a new position for the past 7 months, and it’s been a frustrating job search. I’ve had a few offers, all of which would have required me to relocate, but none that were the right fit until now. Last week I accepted an offer for my dream job that would require me to relocate to Pennsylvania (much higher covid rates...), about 30 miles outside of Philadelphia, with a July 1st start date. 

For my current job, I can work entirely remotely and have been quarantined with my family for over two months. Even if my company goes under, my family has enough savings to be fine for well over a year. However, the new job would require me to be in the office at least 50% of the time, though the entire company is required to wear masks.

Even though this is my dream job, I’m terrified of having to go into the office and of catching the virus. We plan to stay home when I’m not working and get grocery delivery/curbside pickup, but how much chance is there of catching the virus from work with everyone wearing mask and respecting social distancing? Due to my weight I am at an increased risk of severe disease, but I am unclear how much more of a risk (if I catch the virus is there a 5% or 50% chance I die?).

I haven’t had a face to face conversation with someone outside of my immediate family in two months. We’re planning to hire movers and rent an RV to move so we don’t have to get on a plane (also helps with moving a toddler and two dogs), but I wish I had a better understanding of the risk I was  taking to accept my dream job. 

I haven’t given my notice to my current employer, so I’m considering backing out from time to time, but I really don’t want to give up my dream job.

I've been a cashier at a grocery store for the past 4 years, it's my first and only job. I have also have dealt with extreme health anxiety (obsessive worrying over having multiple undiagnosed terminal illnesses and constant googling and observing of symptoms), however, I've had it under control for the past year and a half. In fact, before lockdown started, I had been getting my life back together. However, COVID and quarantine have really caused me to regress with this progress.

I was lucky enough to have had taken off from work the entire week that lockdown started because it just so happened that my spring break was during the same week. I then took a leave of absence from my job for about a month and a half. Within this time both of my parents had contracted COVID 19 and our whole month of April was spent in self-isolation. It was a terrible time, every day I wondered if that would be the last day I'd see either of my parents alive, especially since my father has had COPD for a couple of years now. Luckily, both of my parents recovered and are much better. I don't know if I ever had the virus but I did not have any symptoms at any time.

At the beginning of May my job sent everyone on leave letters basically saying that we had to return to work or quit. At first, I thought returning to work would be okay, so I told them yes, but over the past couple weeks, I could feel my health anxiety returning and the thought of going back to the Petri dish that is my job sends me into a panic. After talking with my therapist, my partner and my parents, I came to the decision that quitting and taking summer courses is the better option for me. But I also have tremendous guilt over quitting, especially because of how I flip floped my response. I feel bad for letting down my very nice boss and for my friends that have no choice but to return to work because of finances. My therapist tells me I am being responsibly selfish, keeping myself and my parents safe while moving ahead with my education. I also feel like I'm damning myself to never find a job or feel financially stable ever again, even though I know that quitting a grocery job at 20 isn't really a make or break decision in the grand scheme of everything.

I don't understand the horrible feelings of anxiety and guilt I'm having, or even how to approach not feeling like this anymore. Have I really doomed myself? Is it okay that I feel as lost and scared as I am?",2020-05-21 05:02:22

My girlfriend, a Physician Assistant, and I have been doing long distance since April of 2019. She finally moved back this April which coincidentally ended up being at the outbreak of Covid-19. I was working in a nursing home at the time so we social distanced, just meeting in parking lots and chatting. I ended up leaving the nursing home and after two weeks we resumed seeing each other (cuddling, eating together, etc.)

That being said, she just was hired to work in the ICU of a hospital. I quite frankly don’t care if I get infected. I just want to see my girlfriend. Unfortunately, I have a roommate. Essentially, no matter how many precautions my girlfriend takes IF she contracts covid I will likely get it and my roommate will likely get it and we could further spread to friends/family. So now we are stuck not being able to see each other again.

I understand why we need to be precautious, but how long are we and other healthcare workers expected to be distant from their families and significant others? Until there’s a vaccine or they contract the disease and can no longer spread it? That may take many months. Infectious diseases have been around forever and we haven’t lived in fear and taken such precautions. I understand that this disease is more infectious than others, but eventually we will have to move on and go back to living our lives and seeing our loved ones who are healthcare workers.

724,I'm a young man (23) and this is how Coronavirus has affected my life.,42,gmymcg,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gmymcg/im_a_young_man_23_and_this_is_how_coronavirus_has/,8,"Hi everyone,

Much like a lot people, I've been feeling pretty alone throughout this ordeal. I wanted to share my story publicly in hopes that it can help my mental state going forward. If you take the time to read through this, I just want to say, thank you!

I don't think I'm alone when I say that the current state of the country is affecting me quite negatively. I lost my job back in late February before Covid-19. It was a big shock at the time because I was barely affording life at the time. I had roughly 1k dollars in my bank account. I was able to live for about a month off of my savings until I had to take out 1.5k from my 401,k. I was doing everything a young man would be doing after being fired. I tried applying for unemployment, but I was rejected. I applied for jobs everyday and got very few leads. I was feeling pretty bummed to put it mildly, then Covid happened.

The few job listing I had managed to get an interview for were cancelled and I was left feeling scared. I had 1.7k in the bank and knew that it wouldn't last long. I kept applying for jobs, to my dismay, I kept getting rejection letter after rejection letter. I cut back on a lot of basics in the process. I started shaving my head, eating beans and hot dogs and cancelled my bi-weekly therapy sessions. My actions were a primary response to my ineligibility to receive the 1.2k stimulus check (I selected ""could be claimed as dependent"" on my 2019 taxes). I have since tried re-applying for unemployment in hopes that my current state will take pity on my situation.

My plan at the beginning of the year was to re-enroll in online school in fall to finish a bachelors degree in psychology, in hopes of moving on to a doctorate program afterwards. However, that dream hasn't been shattered by Covid-19 yet, but I fear it will be. To alleviate some stress, I am switching to online college to make it cheaper and moving across the country, back to my home town. This would be at the beginning of next year (2021). All I can hope is that this change is a good one.

I'm trying to remain positive throughout this pandemic. I've been exercising daily, reading, cooking, writing a good bit and playing guitar. In spite of all these activities, I can't help but feel a major depression brewing in my brain. I've taken it upon myself to read Carl Jung and analyze my dreams (with the use of a dream dictionary), in hopes that I can at least ease some of the depressive feelings. I've pinpointed my issues to financial (I know that's a shocker!). I have 500 dollars in my account. I've started using credit cards to pay bills as this point. I'm waiting for something good to happen through my efforts, fingers crossed.

I always figured that life as a young adult would be uncontrollable at times, but now my expectations have been tested. I hope some of you can relate to this.

Let me just say I don't hate the premise of them. I think they are important to wear if you are sick and you're out in public. Also I don't mean uncomfortable like people generally think that I expected masks to make me feel comfortable I get that. I know their main priority isn't focused on whether or not it's comfortable to wear one. By comfortable to wear I mean without having anxiety while wearing one.

I am one of those who believe it's bad for you to breathe in your own air that you are breathing out. It also feels like someone is taking their hand and covering my face to the point where I feel dizzy after it for more than 10 minutes. How the heck do employees who work 8 hours survive the shift without passing out? They must be taking it off their face every now and then so they can get some decent breathing. 

It makes me anxious wearing one too. As soon as I go to put it on I get overwhelmed. Go ahead and make fun of me or call me a baby over it, but that's how I feel when it comes to putting on a mask and wearing it for a long period of time. It also makes me fear the virus and wanting to go outside the more people I see with masks on. It's a constant reminder that we are living in a world that has one hell of a pandemic going around and who knows what it will slow down to the point where we don't have to wear masks. Not to mention I even get nervous now when someone walks past me even if they are keeping their distance. I just hope this whole thing goes away after a year or two.",2020-05-20 04:43:54

My  73 year old aunt (she lives with my family) had a filling fall out last  week. (The filling was on the back side of a front tooth.) Her dentist  scheduled her for an appointment to get it repaired. The appointment is  tomorrow, mid-morning (in my US state, dentists can start seeing  patients for non-emergency procedures tomorrow).

I'm  really anxious about her going to the dentist. At her age, she's in a  high-risk  group for COVID-19. But she also lives with my father, who is  the same age and has COPD. I (41 y.o.) live with them as well.

We've  all been staying home for two months - we only leave to do curbside pick-up. We do grocery delivery and do not do any in-store shopping. But  this trip to the dentist is causing me a lot of stress. I worry that my  aunt might get infected at the dentist which would be awful on its own.  Worse, she could infect my dad and me.

I  have a couple of questions for dentists. Any answers could go a long  way to making me feel better about this (or toward making me try to talk  my aunt out of this dental procedure):

1. This  is my main question: does my aunt need to go to have this filling  restored? Is this a crucial procedure or can it be put off until the  COVID-19 threat is gone, in a year or two?  
I assume she'll have to  get this repaired sooner rather than later, so as to avoid bigger  problems in the future, but figured I'd ask anyway. I don't know much  about teeth.
2. The dentist's website says everyone at the office will wear KN-95 masks. Do you think this is adequate PPE?
3. My  aunt intends to wait in her car until her appointment so as to minimize  her time in the waiting area/corridors. She'll be wearing a homemade  face mask made of thick fabric. I also told her to touch as little as  possible in the office. Is there anything else she can do to stay as  safe as possible?

Do I leave a comment about it in my rating?,71,gm95ci,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gm95ci/grocery_delivery_people_keep_showing_up_without/,32,"God, I feel like such a Karen for even asking this. But I want to preface this by saying I almost always give a good review, and I tip as well. Times are tough. And I also understand that there are people out there that have breathing issues and can’t wear a mask (though I’m wondering why they’re out grocery shopping for people all day if they’re vulnerable like that...)

HOWEVER. It makes me feel so unsafe when I tell people to drop my stuff off, and they wait at the door for me without a mask on instead of texting and leaving. I give clear instructions every time to just leave my things in the entryway cos I trust people at my apartment complex and it only takes me a minute to walk down there. The only time I don’t mind people sticking around is when they have to scan my ID when I order alcohol. Or if they wait outside the door just to make sure I wave at them and grab my stuff. 

Would I be an ass if I dropped their rating slightly and commented “told them to leave my groceries in the entryway after texting me to come down, but didn’t follow instructions” or “didn’t wear a face mask even though they didn’t stay 6 feet away from me.” Or even just, I don’t know, contact Shipt or DoorDash and tell them they need to have some kind of protocol for this if they don’t already? People are starting to get so lax now with states reopening but the virus isn’t taking a break because of it. :/",2020-05-19 00:11:52
739,Feeling drained from all the takers in my life,30,gmdcid,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gmdcid/feeling_drained_from_all_the_takers_in_my_life/,4,"I feel like I am surrounded by takers who don't really see the seriousness of the Covid situation or care about anything other than their own bubbles and it's starting to get to me. I don't even want to talk to anyone anymore because my depression and anxiety are off the charts. 

My mom is 79 so I am delivering food to her but she is not thankful nor realizes that her favorite foods or supplies are not available now. She complains if I can't get her what she wants. Then she wants me to stay and hang out with her because she is lonely (we both wear masks). She also wants to buy a new car now during safer at home, even though she is getting dementia and shouldn't be driving anymore. She is totally irrational, difficult, and can't be reasoned with. 

My sister is a single mother and decided now to start dating someone during quarantine. She has been so careful this whole time not going out but now her caution went out the door when she met this new guy. Now she wants me to babysit my niece all the time while she goes on dates. There is no father in the picture and my sister said she can't get a babysitter because of the quarantine. 🙄 Not only is she risking her health but my niece's as well. Her rationale is that he's been home too so he's not a risk. 

I am furloughed from work but my boss is giving us guilt trips if we don't come in and help her clean (for free) and get the place ready for when we open again. It's one of those ""we're like a family here"" businesses so she thinks we owe her. She only cares about reopening and not about the potential risks and how it's affecting everyone else. I really don't even want to go back to work and I've really enjoyed being off because it's such a toxic place but I feel like I have no choice but to go back because of the job market. Plus we deal with the public so I will have to wear a mask for 8 hours and risk getting infected by being around co-workers and clients. So far I haven't come in to help so I am getting the silent treatment now from her. 

Basically I feel like all I have in my life are manipulative narcissists who constantly take from me and have no empathy as to how this pandemic is affecting me or the rest of the world. They only care about themselves. I wish I could just run away from everyone. I hate it that I feel so guilty when I don't do what people want from me. I would move but can't because of my husband's job. He is the only person in my life right now who is a positive and caring person (which also makes me sad that I have so few good people in my life) although he doesn't understand why this is all making me so upset.

Anyway, thanks for listening to my doormat rant. Hope everyone is doing ok. 🙏",2020-05-19 03:53:27

I have one more question. Suppose I feel need to rub my eye with my finger. But I do Not have a sanitizer or soap and water. In this case, I rub my finger tip on my palm of other hand quite vigorously to generate a lot of friction and some heat. I hope it should have some effect on killing virus if any.

We both take COVID very seriously and of course don’t wanna jeopardize the health of each other or our roommates. Since social distancing guidelines began we’ve only seen each other in person once (at a park where we maintained more than a six foot distance with masks) and have decided that it would be too emotionally draining for us to make that a regular thing. We’ve been together for eleven months and it’s been really taxing to not being able to see her especially since we were used to hanging out at least like two nights a week. 

We’re still in constant communication, either texting or FaceTiming every day which is nice. Im also writing her a letter every other day or so and I’m saving them until we can see each other again. Hopefully we’ll be able to look back on them for years to come.

I’m curious how other people in the same situation as us have held up. Every day I tell myself we’re one day closer to seeing each other again, but how do you guys feel? Are you hopeful that you’ll see your SO again soon? How are you coping? Hang in there friend!",2020-05-18 21:33:33

I had a great job making just below a 6 figure salary in sales this year only 2 years out of college.  The company I have been at for 1.5 years was forced to lay off myself and a majority of others across our company as a result of the COVID19 pandemic mid-April.  Along with this, I was in a relationship with a woman and things were starting to pick up quickly between us a couple months in, a great feeling I've never had before.  Things just stopped and we mutually agreed to take a break until things start to settle down, and per her choice, we are only supporting each other very minimally.

&#x200B;

I always thought of myself as a mentally strong person, and I know I still am.  But there have been a couple nights the last month where I start to cry myself to sleep (and I rarely cry), and it feels like everything just crashed down literally in a matter of days for me.  It just seems so much is out of my control after I had sacrificed a lot to get to where I was at.  And because my extremely close friends and immediate family are 2,000 miles away, it is hard to find support face-to-face.  There are days where I am extremely motivated to find out what is next and where I will find success.  But then, there's the days where the mental stress just finds it's way to me and I just feel so hopeless.  I know it is normal (at least for these ""times""), and this is not a search for pity, because I know there are millions of other people who are in far worse situations than me.  The main reason it is hard for me is because I am an extremely goal-oriented individual, and now it seems like I can't set the goals I want to.

**Is there any advice for how others have been coping with the economic/personal stress of this pandemic?  What has worked well and what hasn't worked so well for you?  Any advice is appreciated!**  I hope explaining my situation provided context of what may help me.

I’ve tried to minimize my contact with them, but I did deliver groceries and visit on occasion. It has been comforting to know that they’re right there if nothing else.

But later today, they’re leaving and traveling far away. They need to be in a very distant location to sell their house, which had been on the books before this started. For me to visit them, I would either need to drive for 20 hours or else take a flight, neither of which I’m inclined to do right now simply for the sake of visiting.

I’m scared that today is the last time I’ll see one or both of them in person. They’re not in terrible health, but they each have risk factors, and I think my mother would be considered immunocompromised. They’re going to have to stay in a hotel on the drive back. And then the process of moving out of one house and into another is going to involve exposure in so many ways. 

They do know the risks and have been taking precautions, but others clearly aren’t. It seems so selfish for people to insist on not wearing a mask—for no reason—which just bakes in that this will keep going around and kill people.

I’m thankful for this subreddit. Hopefully someone sees this post and realizes they’re not alone if going through this same thing with loved ones. And I would welcome any coping strategies.",2020-05-19 09:11:19

Now my life just seems empty.

I haven't seen my best friend for months because of this shit. I know staying inside and avoid social distancing is the best thing for our health but honestly how is it when I've been feeling so depressed lately. Everyday I just feel dull and go about work and staying at home feeling empty, dull and alone. Then when I am not feeling nothing I'm having mental breakdowns over this shit. 

Honestly what's the point of staying healthy when all I want to do is to get away from life. Don't get me wrong I might be depressed but I won't ever go that far.

I wanted to reach out for some support as a college student who is trying to keep my family, myself and everyone else in the world safe during this time. I came home 3 months ago from college and my family and I have been good about our state stay at home order, which began phase 1 re-opening last week, we have not left our home for about 2 1/2 months unless getting groceries. However, my mom’s medical practice is planning on re-opening soon but she has plastic shields at the front desk, masks, she changes her clothes outside and showers immediately coming in and tends to be a clean freak so I am really afraid of her getting something even though I know eventually things have to start opening. My parents are both in their 50s, my dad had a heart attack 8+ years back but has been fine ever since (cleaned his lifestyle up a lot and is on medications). I know this might not necessarily be a “pre-condition” and being an ex marine I know he is the toughest and can get through anything but these horrible stories about people 40s+ dying suddenly without any pre-conditions has been giving me a lot of panic attacks. The thought of getting any of them sick causes me to stay up and stop eating due to my GAD and somatic symptom disorder which causes me to think I’m sick with something constantly.. the brain is a crazy thing.. 

I will be ending my spring classes in two weeks and will most likely be heading back to my apartment in the city (an hour away) because my job plans on re-opening at the end of June. From being with my two roommates (who go out only for groceries or to see their boyfriends who live next door every now & then), seeing my boyfriend (who’s roommates moved out 2 months ago) and being around my coworkers I am afraid that I will never be able to see my parents again with the risk of bringing something back or something horrible happening like my mom getting sick at work then spreading it to my dad and not being able to come home. l am in my 20s so I think if I get it I will be okay and I am a hypochondriac so I always wear my mask out, wash my hands regularly, have hand sanitizer, change clothes before coming inside/showering immediately, using my own utensils and dishes from my roommates, taking vitamins etc. I am a worrier though and very protective over my family so while they are adults and I know they can take care of themselves/take measures to be safe I feel like I need to be protecting them at all times.

I clean personal clothes and bed linens, I also take all the clothes out to the residents rooms. We have no positive cases but my husband works in a prison that has over 800 positives. He found out Friday night that he had worked with someone Tuesday who tested positive Thursday or Friday. I called in to work so I could talk with the head of infectious disease control, they told me as long as I'm not symptomatic and wearing a mask I can go in. That didn't feel right to me so I contacted the department of health for the state and they said I could still go in.

My husband gets tested tomorrow and will get his results in a day or two. I talked with a few family members and realized I couldn't go in there knowing there's a chance my husband could be carrying it. He cant quarantine to a different room as our home is too small, plus we have a child, and we share a car. We don't need the money I was bringing in so my family will be ok but I feel awful for my coworkers still going in. Especially since they are needing to fill my spot. But I'm worried about being the one to bring it in our facility. 

There's a few people who actually care about their job and the people there but most don't. Honestly this place has a reputation in our town of being awful. And working there, I've seen and heard things first hand that I've encouraged residents to contact the state about. I hate the place but I really care for the residents.

I'm worried how this will effect my chance of another job since this is my first one since my son was born. I've worked there for less than three months and they could fire me for anything.

Basically I feel torn. I don't want to bring it in, but I know nurses or CNAs could bring it also. I can't live with guilt if my husband ends up testing positive and I went in. I feel like I abandoned everyone and I'm just being selfish. I feel like maybe I'm overreacting but because of my anxiety I can't see that. I'm confused and don't know what to do.

Turns out I'm running a fever and they said to assume I have it. I am a young and healthy woman so I'm low risk. I'm getting tested tomorrow and will be quarantining until 7 days after my fever breaks, per doctor's orders.

I was already grieving when this pandemic hit.  I'm 28 years old and I had to move out of my apartment and back in my parents house which is across the country where I live.  I was grieving my financial independence, the life that I built, the friendships I made, the relationship I had, etc.  When it all happened, I still had hope.  I had hope that I was going to save up enough money to get my independence back.  I got a job that was supposed to pay well and I was going to hustle my way back to my old life, but would have had enough saved to improve it.  Now business has slowed down and I'm not making as much as I expected and hoped for.  I'm grieving the timeline.  I'm grieving my hope.  I'm grieving the opportunity to move on from the relationship I lost.  I lived in a lower-risk area so my friends and my ex have more opportunity to socialize with each other outside and in small gatherings.  I can't do that where I am now.  My ex already found someone because dating opportunities aren't as restricted.  My friends are getting together in small gatherings.  I'm just sitting here and going through the motions, not seeing friends, not dating, not having any energy to do what is available to me (youtube videos, reading, meditating, etc).

Days are awful.  I spend my days staring at my ceiling and closing my eyes, hoping to fall asleep, but I can't because it's daytime.  I'm least depressed at night time because it's almost bedtime and I know I can escape reality for a few hours and visit the comfort of my dreams.  I was already depressed.  I was already grieving. When this pandemic hit, these feelings of hopelessness and loss only increased.   How can I be in so much pain and feel numb at the same time? That's how I feel right now.  I don't know how but I wish I could stop feeling this way.  I even started taking Tylenol because I read that there is overlap in the physical and emotional pain receptors and that Tylenol can target that part.  I can't tell if it's really helping, but I don't want to stop because for all I know the pain could be worse without it.  Now I'm rambling but my next therapy session isn't until Tuesday so I need some outlet.

Update: Thank you all for your responses. I really appreciate it. Just FYI I’ve been taking less than the maximum dose of Tylenol since it’s extended release. I see a therapist and my antidepressants have been increased so time will tell how that will work.  I want to allow myself to grieve and be sad but the pain is barely bearable so I numb it until the time passes. Also, please don’t be afraid to share your own experiences with grief on this thread.

So last weekend, my boyfriend and I were tipsy on Skype and his roommate was in the room as well. And out of nowhere I begin screaming at him about the aforementioned issues and how I was going to drive to the nearest town to sleep with a mutual friend when my state ends lockdown, and that I wanted to break up.

We did discuss it and he knew I was drunk and upset and accepted my sincere apology, which didn’t blame him for anything and was completely me owning up to my actions. I know I can’t keep being mad at him for stuff that’s done and dusted. And I know full well covid is not his fault. But now he can’t visit and I don’t know when we’ll see each other again.

My state recently opened, too early in my opinion. Traffic today felt like before the pandemic. Parking lots of retail centers were positively slammed. An electronics store I was interested in quickly stopping at for one item had a 60-customer limit, yet still had a small wait outside. I saw that and just drove on! The masks were almost the only hint of things being not 100% normal.

Does anyone else feel weird about suddenly seeing so many people engaged in so much nonessential activity in such crowded spaces, often without masks? When the streets were empty, I felt normal not wanting to be out on them, either; but now I see news segments showing crowded bars in other states? Would it not be *more* dangerous to be out now?  Part of me says I'm still OK for my quick trips for essentials, and that these people are nuts...but of course, while you're out and about, you just see the others who are out, and not the people who stayed in.

Small 2-room apartment, unemployed roommate. Partner. Ex. Whatever. (?) It's complicated, but we get along quite great as these ""couple stuck together during Covid"" stories go.

I have been super cautious since Covid, rarely leaving home except for work. He had been 100% on board, and had sheltered in place perfectly.

Until this weekend.

I knew that he would do a little grocery shopping as usual while picking up his prescription from Publix. I had already shopped, and I gave him my remaining list, thinking I'd done the bulk of the work and he'd just pick up a few extra things at this one store. So I dozed off for a nap, woke up...and he'd been gone 3+ hours in 3 separate crowded stores shopping! My state recently reopened, *without* the stats to support the decision, and people are out shopping like mad.

But, hey...he scored us some hand sanitizer! 

I told him I would rather we didn't *need* hand sanitizer, than risk contracting the virus while acquiring it!

He is aware of this post, and says to say he wore a mask. I know his heart was in the right place, but I am frustrated. He's a news junkie, the *good* kind of science-based news. He *knows* better. 

I also should have known better in my own shopping, which was longer than I feel it should have been; but I shopped during less-busy hours, and for less in-store time, also with a mask. I think the instinct here was we were each making our trips ""count."" We're set for weeks to come.

Do I claim a room for 2 weeks while waiting to see that we're both OK? Or am I over-reacting?

I currently live with two other roommates - we get along well, and the quarantine times have been pretty good so far, we've found ourselves a pretty good flow and rhythm of doing both things apart and together.

However - spring is fully breaking out and the parks and flooded with people. One of my roommates has been talking, and now seeing (on distanced walks) a person that they seem very fond of and has expressed ""how difficult, and close to impossible"" it is, and my other roommate has worded that ""it's not possible for me to abstain if this lasts throughout the summer"", meaning that they can't avoid sexual contact if social distancing continues. 

I have not practiced the rules myself - I have continued to see my girlfriend who lives, and isolates by herself (only going out for groceries, and do not get close with anyone else than me). I have had as an excuse for myself that she is alone, and therefore minimises the contact with other people. Perhaps that is only for me to feel better, that I say it put it that way. However, if my roommates would disagree with this arrangement, I would stop seeing my girlfriend no questions asked.

I find it troublesome to know that I break the social distancing rules, and that I am therefore in no position of questioning their choices. However, I do not feel comfortable with the thought of them breaking the social distancing rules with 1. a new person that do NOT live alone, and that none of us roommates know of. 2. my other roommate feeling that they need to have sexual encounters, which leaves a lot of parameters out of control.

We were drinking so at the time I didn’t process the info, but it just now occurred to me that she so easily could have been exposed and then came into my home with young children. Another friend of my fiancé is going to the local outlets tomorrow and invited us because *yay crowds!* right? So I realized that he, too, has been the type to not care about this virus and he’s been to our home several times. 

I tried discussing it with my partner and he felt obligated to agree with me that his friends should no longer be welcome in our home but I could tell it bummed him out, and if he gets invited to go out he will want to go. So it’s like if ur gonna still be around these people and then come home to us you might as well just continue letting them in here.

It’s very difficult and unnatural to live in isolation long term. I don’t wanna give up the few friends we have because we already don’t have *any* family in this state.

I've tried lotion and things like that, but it doesn't really help. 
I took two weeks off with PTO and my skin started to get better, but the very first day I came back to work, my skin was back to being dry and painful. I have a few different masks, made from different materials, so I don't think it has anything to do with the specific masks I'm using. The lower half of my face is always tight and irritated and I don't know what to do to keep this from happening.
One customer the other day was talking about how it isn't healthy to wear face masks for so long and that I should take a break whenever there are no customers in the store. But that just isn't how it works. There are never zero customers where I work. I'm alone at the register and can't leave it to take a breather. The managers also pick favorites, and never like to put me in the back or the deli, where it's easier to take breaks and less socially exhausting.

Talking to my friends through calls isn't enjoyable and distracting anymore. It feels like they are on other planet. It feels like no one cares about me at all. Absolutely everthing I had planned for the year is on its head. I have nothing. I have no one to talk to. Feels like I'm reliving the same fucking day over and over. Feels like time doesn't exist anymore. Even sleep isn't safe anymore since I'm having recurring nightmares.

For now, I'm not * actually * considering killing myself. I know I won't do it. But the idea of suicide is crossing my mind an awful lot these past few days.

On Monday:

- My landlord illegally entered my home (I live alone) while I was out and invaded my privacy (quick pause here - my place looked like a tornado blasted through it due to my extreme depression, with personal objects lying around everywhere; needless to say I felt extremely embarrassed and violated) and berated me for being depressed.

- My relationship with my father fell apart.

- My “friends” who I would do anything for and have helped through rough times told me to deal with it on my own and have ignored me since.

- I went to the hospital in crisis threatening to hurt myself and I was sent home with an Ativan after a 5 minute interview with a doctor who was convinced I wasn’t a safety threat.

- My BetterHelp therapist, who I text-livestreamed this whole ordeal to, has ghosted me. 


On top of that, today after I called out my landlord on entering my home illegally, he, who I might add has constantly and blatantly sexually harassed me, threatened me with eviction for “being an ass” -- but falling under the excuse that “a family member wants to move in”.


I am at my wits’ end. I feel incredibly alone and hopeless. All attempts to reach out for professional help have been in vain and I am so discouraged. Now I must accept the fact that as soon as the pandemic eviction laws are lifted, I will likely either be evicted or be harassed enough to be forced into moving out.


I am a musician. As you can imagine my income has been completely shattered by the pandemic. I have no promises for any upcoming gigs after the pandemic and I certainly cannot afford to move into another home by myself (I know - “Boohoo, cry me a river. Why not just have roommates?” The state of my mental health right now makes having roommates an unimaginable challenge, but it’s likely something I’ll have to face in order to have a home). 


Ba-dum, tss.

Edit: I am SO thankful for all the support. It's certainly been a hard time, I haven't been eating or sleeping, and I've added restraints on my door to help me feel safe.

She said that I'm not allowed to be sad or upset about a relationship because of covid-19,22,gk924z,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gk924z/when_your_female_friend_makes_you_feel_horrible/,10,"This has been bothering for more than a month but I need to get it out of my chest. Usually I don't care about what people say about me, but there's something really hurtful about this and it made me further wonder how we can be better to each other.

Short background of myself: I've been single for several years due to an unfortunate, painful relationship. For some reason, I was ashamed that I dated this guy and never talked to anyone about it. It did traumatized me and from that breakup I decided to be single, I didn't want to waste my time in the dating scene and only wanted to focus on myself. Did a lot of solo traveling, took classes of my interests, came out of my introvert shelf to try and make new friends (sometimes succeeded and failed)....even though I felt unbearably lonely at times, it was a good learning experience for me. Well after 4 years of being single, I turned 29 and craved a new relationship... but rather than dating random men, I told myself to pick someone I knew I would be very attracted to and would treat me with respect/kindness.

Moved to London 3 years ago and last year I finally met someone that I was very much attracted to, luckily he felt the same for me. We started dating, even though he would only see me for 2 days a month it was still a wonderful dating experience for me.

Unfortunately I had to move out of London literally right before the pandemic and lockdowns started, I was not able to say goodbye to this guy because of the sheer chaos and panic in the city. The night before my flight, it got a bit emotional and I did shed a few tears a bit because of the uncertainty of it all, whether or not I could see him ever again. Then my friend (flatmate) saw me at that moment. She said goodbye to me in the driest manner, I wondered why she went all distant towards me but I assumed she completely lost it as the virus situation escalated.

When I arrived back home (away from London and had to self-quarantine alone), I texted my friend saying I arrived safely. However the next thing I knew I was receiving a cold message from her that I never expected at all. I believe she had these thoughts in her mind, but never bothered to say it to me face-to-face while we were living together.

Firstly, she criticized me for crying over this guy, basically saying that I should ""focus on my own maturity and growth to be more independent"" especially during this time. I was immediately hurt by these words, given that I have spend years focusing on being independent as a single woman and never thought about being codependent. But it also disturbs me that *she is implying that I am not allowed to be upset or sad about a relationship because of cover-19*. She then compares me to people sleeping rough or not having a home/anything to look forward to, saying that I am not responsible enough to be a respectable citizen of society and need to be more self-sufficient. These words really hurt. When I was living in London, I faced several unfair treatment from employers and landlords, I had an unfortunate time of moving from one job to another and one flat to another. It was a brutal, unexpected and unstable time. The guy I was dating gave me some happy moments. (fyi my friend is a high school teacher, living with her partner).

To this day I don't understand why she can say such a thing. It makes me sad that she is a teacher, does she say the same hurtful things to her students? In this time when mental health is at its peak level, those words were not necessary. Isn't our emotions all over the place right now?",2020-05-15 17:25:12

This means we can start seeing extended family and a few friends again, but obviously we can't have large gatherings just yet. Some of my friends have already asked me to hang out with them and even though I've become quite comfortable staying at home these past two months and not seeing anyone, I figured since the weather's getting warmer I should try to enjoy the outdoors at least a little bit this summer. I'm not gonna swarm the beaches like SOME other people are (not like I went to the beach much pre-COVID anyways), but I thought about going on a few hikes and having ""social distancing picnics"" where we all sit in someone's backyard with our chairs/mats six feet apart from one another. And while we're at it, we're probably all gonna wear masks when we see each other. In my honest opinion, if wearing masks everywhere is our new normal, at least it'll make us look kinda badass.

Nonetheless, I'm still questioning whether it's safe to plan a hangout with my high school friends after next week. My friends and I are all Chinese-Canadian and some of us were already paranoid about the virus before it escalated into a pandemic. And looking back, I wonder how much of their paranoia was justified - anyone could be carrying the virus and transmitting it to other people. But then, besides helping restart the economy, is there any other reason why my province would be lifting social distancing restrictions if they still don't want us to see other people this summer and pass them the virus?

I probably still won't be going out TOO much this summer, 1. because it isn't totally safe yet, 2. there aren't too many friends I DESPERATELY want to see in-person right now when I can stay in touch with them virtually as I've been doing since March, and 3. I'm taking some classes online that have actually been pretty time-consuming so far. But I do still want to find some excuses to wear all my nice summer clothes, even if this means dressing up simply to sit in my garden with my mom every day. Plus, my university's fall semester is going to be mostly online, too. Should I just accept defeat and continue isolating myself at home for the rest of 2020 and until they find a vaccine?

I don’t want life to return to normal.

I love all the free time I have right now. I’ve used that time to learn how to cook, exercise, read, and even started learning how to trade stocks. I feel so productive and I’m quite literally thriving under quarantine.

I also love not feeling obligated to interact with people. If I’m outside for a walk, it’s not considered rude to go 6ft around other people and not make eye contact. In stores I wear my mask and people keep their distance from me. I can keep to myself and it’s not considered strange. I enjoy this quarantine so much and I feel like I’m going to be sad when I have to give up my new hobbies and free time. I’m very introverted and I always have thrived on quiet alone time so I think that’s why I feel this way. Does anyone else feel like this too?",2020-05-13 22:41:18

But it was ok because as a senior, I had a girlfriend, I had an in with somebody who was gonna let me take their Porsche, it was gonna be an awesome night in the city and I had been talking about it for months.

We break the rules and do something every week or two but I miss her all the time.

Now, summer is gonna be under lockdown too and guess what?! The college I am going to is all online first semester and hers isn’t... we are going to have to go the entire first semester without seeing each other. She’s gonna go meet new people and have new experiences while I just sit home and stay here without her. We’re strong but it’s not like we’re engaged or something rn and most high school relationships that end in college end then... so then I’m gonna be here, without my friends, without my girlfriend, with no activities to be able to help me take my mind off of things and I’d still have to be in college classes.

I came across this page by accident and I’m glad I did. I spent a while reading different posts (ranging from people who feel like they don’t have a desire to go out again, to those who are running out the doors once we are COVID-19 free).  As an Occupational therapist, I work with a lot of people with anxiety. One common thing a lot of my clients have been telling me is how their mood has improved since COVID-19 has begun.  That’s almost the complete opposite from what people in my everyday life would report. When I ask them why they feel better, they begin to tell me it’s because they are no longer being forced to get back out there and engage with others/run errands/attend appointments in person.

While COVID-19 may feel like a vacation to some (or a death sentence to others), I would suggest developing habits to ensure you have an easy transition when things go back to “normal”.  I know a lot of us believe that “normal” will not look like what it did before, but there will still be some expectation to leave the home once in a while.  I genuinely feel worried that people will fall deeper and deeper into the idea that home is safety and the world is a dangerous place.

If you are finding yourself being more fearful of the world each passing day, I encourage you to take small steps when getting back out there. With any goal, make sure it’s SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time sensitive). So instead of making a goal that I will go out more, try to make a more specific one like:
1) I will sit on my porch Monday afternoon for 10 minutes
2) I will drive to the Walmart parking lot across the street, and sit in my car while I people watch for 10 minutes

None of what I’m saying is exactly earth shattering. But by making SMART goals and exposing yourself to the community in small steps, you’ll find the transition back into society a bit more manageable each day. 

Just thought I’d share my 2 cents. 

Good luck everyone.",2020-05-14 04:23:02

I am not in the slightest attempting to minimalize the situation, I know very well the dangers. I just basically want an outside person to nudge me a little and give me some insight as to what would be right in this situation, I guess?

a brief pause in my daily pacings,  
having neither worked up an appetite  
nor sated the worries in my head.  
But I stop at the fridge, again, once more again  
addicted to eating my feelings,  
gobbling them up in huge chunks  
of homemade sourdough bread  
and stocked meat to outlast the factory shutdowns.  
Maybe there'll be gaps in the supply chain,  
maybe there won't.  
Maybe I'll wake up some day and this  
will all have been a fever dream,  
and the Beforetimes will spring back  
alive again, like they never left us.  
Maybe they won't.  
Maybe I need to stop thinking of all the maybes.  


Today, I eat.  


Pink was once the new black,  
now stress eating is the new pants.  


But for just a moment,  
my hand pauses on the fridge door handle,  
my eyes locked on the collage of souveniers  
of the normal times we left  
before the world was cancelled.  


I take the trinkets in like something foreign,  
peering over old movie tickets and invitations,  
photos of New Year's Eves, weddings, baby showers.  
Friends all smiling, friends all together.  
When we could gather with no thought of death or disease or virus or numbers--  
Magnets from places that seem like they're a universe away,  
someplace I once lived that is closed off to me now.  
Cass Railroad, South of the Border,  
Shenandoah National Park,  
Independence Hall,  
How I long to visit the english daisies and marigolds  
of Hershey Gardens once again-- photos aren't good enough  
photos don't warm your face in the sun or bring you back to the scent  
of an eden hidden in the mountains of Pennsylvania.  
They just remind me of better long ago days.  
I miss the times of easy travel, just jump in the car and go.  
Postcards of Florida, Maine, South Carolina, Connecticut  
all decorate the white bareness of my fridge with stinging reminder  
of all the places I can't return to until this passes over,  
until we're all free of this nightmareish new normal.  
A smiling tiki god stares at me from a Disney's Polynesian magnet,  
I wonder if Cinderella's castle misses me...  
A Fright Lane pass from King's Dominion is tacked to the cork,  
Two years ago, haunted houses were scary.  
Now, we're living where everything is terrifying.  
Tickets scattered and pinned,  
Smithsonian Museum, Virginia Aquarium, Woodford Reserve--  
where I could drink bourbon and then go look at all the pretty little Kentucky horses.  
Colonial Williamsburg, Luray Caverns,  
general admissions to tours and sights to see;  
when there still were sights to see  
and not just four bare walls to hold me in.  
Now, I vacation in my living room, travel to my bedroom and summer in my closet  
and wonder if I will ever return to wild summer road trips,  
getting junk food at the gas stations that we passed through,  
looking at the exit signs as they flew by and classic rock played,  
wind in my hair, arm out the window, free and full of life--  
when the road called to me and I could join its song.

Where I live, the lockdown has eased the past weeks (with good reason since apparently we got a good start and we seem to have things under some control). One of the businesses that open again are music classes at local spots; I was taking vocal classes at one of those. I was glad some few months ago when they closed because singing (involves spitting etc) in a small room with students coming in and out and my teacher being in close contact with all of us, stressed me out.

Thing is, these issues haven't been resolved. Covid19 is here to stay. The classrooms are still small. In summer, we usually turn on AC units but this is also dangerous now. We generally have to keep any windows closed so that we do not bother the residents around us.  Very importantly, and I don't know whether other people who sing for hobby or work worry too about this, Covid19 can have a very serious impact on the respiratory system.  3 years ago I had  laryngitis and bronchitis which turned to asthmatic bronchitis. It SUCKED BALLS. I lost my voice for a week and was unable to sing for a year. My whole body was weak for at least 8 months. It took 2 years of work to strengthen my voice to a point I was even better than before. I don't want to lose this again.

Also I have seen no income these past months and it is unsure when I will be able to work again to be able to afford the classes. I am scared that my teacher (coach, whatever) will drop me but I guess I should better discuss this with her before having such worries. Then again, if I don't take classes now, during summer, then when? Autumn? Winter? We're talking about a second wave of covid19 but also, flu season.

I just.....I don't even know. Skype classes aren't very common around here and I don't believe they help as much as in-person ones. Singing is lots of things from posture to everything else. And it will require some equipment if we want to be able to have a good skype lesson. But it's worth looking into and discussing it. I used to think that singing classes are like therapy and cost less. It was true.

Is anyone facing something similar? There are other arts like dancing.... when dancing studios/academies are given the green light how will you react? I just wanted this out there. Thanks for reading.",2020-05-15 00:40:46

But the fact that social distancing may last well into next year or even 2022 is killing me. Quite frankly I'd rather die than live like this for that long. I don't care what anyone says I cannot function like this till a vaccine.

Literally 90% of anything I enjoy doing is a non essential activity. Restaurants, salons, shopping, concerts, travel. All fucking canceled for the foreseeable future. I've been going on walks sometimes & playing video games which I do enjoy, but after nearly 2 months of this shit that isn't even enjoyable anymore.

I still have a job which I'm thankful for income. But I literally cannot continue to work from home. It's 10x more stressful than going to the office & it's so hard to get things done & stay organized. I literally sit at a folding table in my kitchen with my laptop & cry all day because I'm so stressed. Literally the only good thing is when 5pm comes and I can start drinking. 

I haven't seen my friends and literally idk when I will be able to hang out with them again? I can't do any of my self care that normally helps me de stress a bit (getting a manicure or even a fucking hair cut). I've spent hundreds of dollars on concert tickets & travel for this summer & the majority of them have all been postponed already. I hope I'll be able to do some of these things in the fall but I fear that it's just simply gone forever.

A few weeks ago when this all started the 1st goal was to slow the spread. I was fine with that. Then it became give the hospitals time to prepare. That was also fine. Now where I am the goal was/ still is testing. Frustrating, but fine. Now with each passing day the narrative seems to change/ get closer to lockdown forever or until a vaccine. That I seriously don't think I can live with. Even on our local news it seems like they've replaced ""temporary new normal"" to just ""new normal"" and that's terrifying.

I sound like such a pathetic spoiled brat but I genuinely feel I  will never have fun again. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I was doing well for awhile but now I'm back to crying for like 6 hours of my day. This is no way to live. I fear it will never end.

How to manage that anxiety?,12,gjeqbq,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gjeqbq/if_you_had_to_go_to_the_hospital_would_you_feel/,8,"Ok guys ... if you absolutely HAD to go to an urban hospital that you knew had COVID cases how would you prepare? Obviously I know medical PPE needs to be for the employees - but what kinds of DIY stuff would you use? 

I’ve been avoiding the hospital like crazy but I’m very ill (non-COVID) and the doctors really want me to come in for urgent tests. They are taking a LOT of precautions with me but I’m still really worried about going and so I want to take my own precautions as much as possible. Or I may not go. I’m trying to prepare as best as I can including ensuring I have supplies so I don’t need to buy/eat/drink anything while I’m there. 

I’m trying to make a pro/con list. My city locked down early & aggressively and so all my tests & appts were cancelled even though I was considered “urgent”... so at this point there’s been an 8 week delay in my care and the doctors are concerned enough to want to bring me in and I’m having a hard time justifying delaying any longer due to “anxiety”. But the anxiety is also very severe. 

I also haven’t left my house at all for 8 weeks. Which is a privilege (ie that I’m able to do that & get deliveries etc) but also a curse as I’m becoming almost agoraphobic. 

I would appreciate any tips. I know for 14 days after I go I’m going to have a huge uptick in anxiety but I have to balance that with the regret I will feel if I end up dying because I’m too stubborn to go for care :(. Anyone else been through this?

So far the cons are pretty obvious - risk of exposure and/or risk of such an increase in anxiety that I end up with severe issues from that. Anxiety is very bad for my pre-existing condition and it can be life threatening. 

Pros include the chance to get in for tests before we start to re-open at which point there will be a LOT more patients. Right now there are very few patients and they are taking a lot of precautions. Also there’s still enough attention given to COVID that anyone I pass while out will hopefully also be taking precautions. Most importantly it will hopefully help us explain why I’ve been so sick and if it’s something treatable then perhaps I can start feeling better 🤷‍♀️. 

Finally - I figure going in might help my agoraphobia. It’s so severe now and my health is suffering from lack of physical activity and fresh air (I live in a 500 square foot condo with no balcony). I think if I can survive the stress of a hospital visit I will likely be able to be comfortable with things like going for a walk or a drive ... and that would really help me.

My tentative PPE plan would include a mask with filter (that I already have due to my other condition), gloves, a hairstyle and hair covering that keeps my hair from touching anything as I have very long hair. Possibly sunglasses as I don’t have goggles. I will be sure to stay 6 feet from anyone and if possible avoid using the washroom or eating /drinking while I’m out. 

Thanks everyone - I’m embarrassed by how scared I am but I hope this is the right place to discuss it.",2020-05-14 07:50:28

A lot of this education would point me towards the pro-lockdown direction, but, instead I'm feeling very anti-lockdown lately and I've been getting backlash from my fellow scientists as a result. 

The thing is, my truth is very different from what they are experiencing. They have the luxury of telling the general public that we need to lockdown or cancel mass gatherings until there is a vaccine while still having the ability to either work from home or having to work for the healthcare system (and also acknowledging that the average vaccine takes a decade to be mass-produced). While I have to sit at home and listen to my roommates, who both work for the restaurant industry, talk about wanting to commit suicide because their dream jobs are cancelled until further notice. I work for the research side of a major hospital and we are facing the possibility of layoffs and furloughs because the hospital lost so much money to having to cancel non-COVID related procedures and the fact that job-loss means loss of health insurance in the US. 

The complete disregard for the collateral damage caused by these lockdowns has me furious. Mental health, substance abuse, stress-induced illnesses, homelessness, and the fear of going to the doctor leading to those who could've been saved dying or having long-term damage (referring to the fact that heart attacks, strokes, and other non-COVID related emergencies are at a decline lately due to people not going to the ER anymore) are ALSO PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH! We seem to be sacrificing all other areas of public health for one small area for a disease that's proving more and more to be LESS deadly than we originally thought for the average person. 

It's becoming harder and harder to respect scientists through all of this. They have clearly bought into the doom and gloom and have completely abandoned all rational thought while insulting those who are suffering due to lockdowns. I am a big proponent of scientists getting a better reputation in the general public, but this is definitely ruining that for me. 

Don't get me wrong, I have also been in contact with amazing scientists that are focusing on this disease. Having a virologist as one of my program heads has been a huge help and he's been very reasonable about all of this. He seems similar to me with this: he wants the push to be towards funding contact tracing, antibody testing, and increased incidence testing. He despises the fact that these lockdowns have been extended without these, basically making them and the collateral damage last longer. There seems to be a growing number of scientists and healthcare workers who are worried about the collateral damage as well, and I hope they get more attention soon.

827,Hey everyone I thought I would give an update on how my mental health is going.,5,gjcmkn,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gjcmkn/hey_everyone_i_thought_i_would_give_an_update_on/,2,"So I made a post a while back about how this pandemic has been effecting my mental health. Sadly it hasn't gotten any better. I know people have said some kind words and have tried to get me to cheer up and for that I am grateful. I can't help but still worry and have more mental break downs over this pandemic.  


I don't think I have ever had anything this bad before aside from my fear of dying alone. Thankfully I do have someone very dear to me in my life that I love and care for. She has easily been one of the best things to have ever happened to me and I never take our love for granted. Life was looking up with her in my life and looking to get a job that would allow us to get a place together. Now that has halted due to the pandemic. We used to love to go to the mall together that won't happen again or won't be the same. I get upset whenever I go out and look around seeing people wearing a mask. Sure I get that it's to keep other people safe which is 100% fine and expected. It's just the more I see people walking around in them is a constant reminder that things aren't the same anymore.  


Not to mention people bring up the fact that after this is over there will be a ""new normal"" and that doesn't make me feel better it makes me feel more anxious. Will the ""new normal"" mean I will still have to stay away from being able to see my friends and family? Does the ""new normal"" mean everywhere I go I will see people in face masks for the long term future? Does it mean that going to events, concerts, etc. will be even more hectic because there will be even more protocols in place for attending?  


That alone is just a small sample of what goes through my mind. When I don't worry about those things for a brief moment I think about how life was when we could go to all these wonderful places, events, concerts and traveling to different places. Whenever I think of how good we used to have it that makes me the most upset. Being able to see a movie with friends and family, traveling with the girlfriend to events that we loved to attend to, enjoying my time with my friends doing whatever we wanted to, etc. Just all these thoughts is what I think about day in and day out and honestly I don't know what to do about my feelings anymore. I write on here to let it all out and to let other people know how I am personally handling this pandemic and I am sure I am not the only one out there who is feeling the same way. Bottom line is that I am really starting to think this whole thing has got me to the point where my mental health won't go back to where it was even with there being a ""new normal"".",2020-05-14 05:34:11

A few days ago our proposed 'road map' was released for when apparently things will start opening up. Apparently non essential retail might start opening back up in June.

And honestly, I don't feel super confident about going back to work. The shop I work in is pretty small so I know social distancing in there is going to be kind of hard. Like it's hard enough some days to have room between say 3-4 staff members if we're doing stuff like pricing up stock and sorting through delivery boxes and then add a customer or two on there and it's a bit of a squash.

Also on a financial level I don't see much point. The shop I work in is within a 'designer outlet' type of shopping centre so we're full of mid-high end brands. The shop I work in is one of the mid range brands and we're an outdoor gear shop. 

And like I just see there's going to be little demand for us in the coming months. Around now we'd be gearing up for like the summer holiday, festival, scout camp rush etc. And since no one can really go anywhere and probably won't for a while is there really any point in opening.   
That and the fact the centre I work in relies typically a lot on like tourists coming through. Like both European and further abroad. In the weeks leading up to the lockdown a lot of the shops voluntarily closed we suffered like an extremely severe drop in customers and I spent my shifts those last few weeks essentially trying to keep myself busy because no one was coming in, like one of the last days we were open we managed to only just get 10 customers in.

For the first two months of lock-down we were very quarantined, with a monthly grocery trip being the greatest chance of exposure.

After 2 months we decided to open up to my sibling who has 2 small children.  Working from home and being a full time day care was too much for the parents to handle and it doesn't look like things are going to go back to normal for a very long time.

I help babysit and the kids also go to their other grandparents house.  So essentially we're 3 separate households that have combined.

One of the grandparents recently went to the hospital for a non-COVID-19 issue (they tested negative) and spent 2 days at the hospital.  They're home now and the kids will resume going to their place.

I am concerned about the chance they might have been exposed to the virus during their hospital stay.  My sibling and their in-laws don't seem bothered by this or feel a need to quarantine first.

Before we started seeing the kids too, our chances of being exposed to the virus were very slim.  My parent takes this very seriously and actually started worrying back in Feb well before most of the world.  By merging with two other households I feel like our chance of exposure went up significantly.  This hospital trip feels like the boundary keeps getting pushed a little more each time.

There seems to be so many people that are asymptomatic or get very mild flu symptoms.  But I also see articles of otherwise healthy people in their 30s, 40s and 50s having severe illness or death.  I can't tell if I am being over-reactive to say I won't see them for 2 weeks.  It has been nice to see the kids and I know they need more interaction and playtime which I'm happy to offer.  

If I do decide to stop seeing them for 2 weeks they'll tolerate the decision but think we're being overly cautious and judge us behind our backs.  I don't like being put in a position where trying to make safe cautious choices makes me appear snobby, cold or overreactive.  And maybe nothing would happen and he didn't get the virus at the hospital.  It's impossible to say.

I was wondering if anyone could advise or point me in the right direction. I feel my situation is pretty niche but if someone has been/is in this situation that would be even better.

I am a theatre practitioner in a UK hospital, currently living in hospital accommodation (we normally live about 30 mins drive away in a nearby town) as my SO is 37 weeks pregnant with our first child. So i've not seen her or been directly involved in our pregnancy for almost 2 months. Due to being asthmatic my face-to-face time with patients is currently more or less zero, however I am still obviously working in fairly close proximity with those who are face-to-face with patients (although they are wearing PPE of course). I have asked at work for advice but they have been frustratingly standoffish in this respect.

Obviously I want to be present for the birth and one of the few pieces of advice from my managers is that it should be fine for this to be the case. I'll be taking 2 week's paternity leave once baby arrives, but i'm concerned about what I should do once back at work. I don't drive and my SO is worried about me taking public transport to and from work as I was doing prior to Corona. The alternative would be her driving me to and from work which would mean bringing baby with us every time. Another, unacceptable in my eyes, alternative would be to move back in to hospital accommodation. I am extremely reluctant to appear to be shirking my responsibilities as a healthcare professional however I am even more reluctant to put my family at risk. At the same time since i've been made non-patient-facing I feel like my contribution to the work load is severely diminished so I wonder would I really be that missed if I was to not be at work.

So... what would you do in my situation? Happy to clarify things if needs be. Thank you in advance for any and all advice! (Sorry for the long post!)",2020-05-13 18:25:07

The person I live with and I have been having minor symptoms for a while now. Over a week for me (maybe two, I should've been counting the days but everything's been a blur since March,) and just under for them.

Today, they are getting tested. If they test positive, it's safe to assume I have it as well, since I started having symptoms first. But I may get tested anyway just to know? If they test negative, I will definitely be getting tested because of the known false negative rate. I'm willing to pay for antibody testing in the future for the same reason, even if it feels like ""wishful"" thinking at that point.

I'm scared of the swab, but... willing to endure it I need to.

On one hand, I keep dismissing it like ""oh it's not so bad so it must not be the virus,"" or ""it *could* be anything."" On the other, it begs the question of what the hell is going on if it's not COVID? I'm experiencing things I've never experienced before. I'm one of those people who has a really strong immune system generally, so what's more likely, some run of the mill virus I've been exposed to before presenting with brand new, strange symptoms... or the highly contagious virus that's caused a pandemic that I've never encountered previously?

I'm scared, but nothing has happened that made me feel like I need medical attention yet. I was at the hospital recently but it was for an unrelated reason (perhaps that's where I picked it up, if it is COVID.) I know this could change, and I'm staying vigilant.

I'm afraid the act of waving at someone and saying hello is going to become something that's looked down upon, and that a hug is going to be akin to assaulting someone, and that friends and family will abandon one another using ""Social Distancing"" as an excuse, that no one will take the time and be kind to people. Without getting political, I appreciate that my governor is specifically calling this ""physical distancing"" because it's a lot more accurate and easier to understand, but very few people are using this term. I understand that people are dying, but I won't lie if I told you I was starting to feel suffocated, and I have the luxury of being with my parents and brother during this, and I cannot imagine how people who live alone are feeling.

And sometimes at the worst of my anxieties, I fear these things will never truly come back. I just want to live a fun life & I don’t really know what to do.",2020-05-13 03:43:05
848,Feeling guilty for getting a therapist.,10,gimy1w,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gimy1w/feeling_guilty_for_getting_a_therapist/,4,"A month ago I felt like I was thriving amidst this pandemic. I was working from home a few times a week and so was my fiancé. 

It’s now a month later and I’m back at the office working 4 10 hr shifts which are mildly grueling. I felt so proud of myself but now I’m considering talking to someone. Is it normal that I’m having a hard time looking at the positives right now? My anxiety has definitely flared. I just was so convinced that I could get thru this transitional time with the normal amount of stress, but now I don’t even know what is considered as “normal”. 

I keep thinking about the “hard times” I had to endure in the past and think, wow, you had no idea how easy you had it then! Literally, I’m reminiscing about the “hard times” from the past, like when I was in college stressed out of my mind or when I was in a long distance relationship.

It makes me sad that I have this urge to daydream of the past, but frankly I don’t quite know how I can look forward to the future if we’re essentially going to be shut down for the next 2 years. Oof. 

I’ve seen a therapist before and when I stopped seeing her towards the end, I thought to myself, I’m happy I don’t really need to see her anymore. But now, I just keep thinking to myself “Why do I feel so doom and gloomy? Is this normal?”

I have waves of happy moments and laughter, but then this weird anxiety/depression is lurking in the back of my head, like background noise, and it sucks.",2020-05-13 03:22:56
849,I hate teaching from home,15,giij9u,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/giij9u/i_hate_teaching_from_home/,9,"I'd like to vent a little bit. I know these negative feelings aren't something that anyone could help me sort, but myself.

I feel so lonely and tired, though.

I miss the routine of being at school and the structure of having schedules. That was of so much help when I wasn't sure about the pacing of an assignment. Kids just *achieved* things, there was the chance for self assessment, peer assessment, self reflection, group talk. Fuck, group talk was of so much help to feel around their general level and topics of interest that I could use for lessons. Now I have nothing.

I feel like teaching from home is the worst possible idea because none of us has ever been trained to do it, it's lonely, and -at least I think- my study materials are *shit*. I despise everything, every single document I have submitted for the school's website for the kids to study. If it had been up to me, I wouldn't have submitted them, but there was a deadline and we're being judged on our response to the crisis. I have been told *by my own students* that no one is doing the EFL assignments anyway, so what's the point!? Why bother?? The entire thing is flawed as well. The kids struggled when we had them do worksheets in the classroom, of course they're going to struggle ten times as much when told to do all the work on their own, alone, at home. We're just uploading documents on a website. That's all.

Then when I try to look up any articles, anything really that could help me motivate myself to just *work*... there's nothing. Pages and pages of results about ""how to motivate my students"". I feel like I'm expected to function no matter what... which is true. I was still teaching while struggling with panic attacks, extreme anxiety and suicidality last year. I only took a break because I went to the doctor for medication (to keep showing up) but she put me on a 1-month medical leave first, *then* she gave me a prescription.

I *am* grateful I'm one of the lucky ones who got to keep their job and work from home. I *want* to keep working and trying to help. But I'm exhausted. I just feel like crying all the time.

TL;DR: tired teacher takes a break from wanting to die during the pandemic to vent so she can type up more study materials for online classes that help basically no one.",2020-05-12 23:33:06

And I LOVE taking walks, but wearing a mask has been unbearable for me. I live in NYC, so of course I DO wear a mask whenever I must go out. 
I have an anxiety disorder and the primary method I use to maintain my composure is by controlling my breathing. I also suffer from a panic disorder, and restricted breathing can trigger my panic attacks.
Wearing a mask puts me in a completely altered state simply because, as I'm sure you all have experienced, the air I'm breathing is hot and thick and lacks oxygen. I've talked myself through my anxiety for years by telling my brain that I'm okay as long as I can breathe - and now it feels as though I can't.

My mom is a healthcare worker and tells me relentlessly that the masks I'm wearing are SO MUCH BETTER than the N95s she wears at work. I believe her, but that doesn't mean that it's easy for everyone to live with their mouth and nose covered.

853,"Husband had emergency surgery, I'm in another country",4,gilrrg,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gilrrg/husband_had_emergency_surgery_im_in_another/,10,"Sorry this is a long post. TL;DR: husband had emergency surgery, I am still deciding whether to go to him or not. 

My husband (41)had an emergency open heart surgery last week and is in recovery at the hospital, while I (34) am in another country and the anxiety is eating me up everyday. My worst fears have unraveled the past week that it has happened, where I feel helpless and very very anxious; I was afraid of my husband getting sick and here he was, almost dying and I am not there for him nor do I have any information that can ease my fears. There is an ocean that separates us so it's not easy to just fly to where he is (it's a 12-hour direct flight). The anxiety and stress is so great sometimes that my face broke out and so much of my hair is falling (I was already anxious about this situation and now it has been compounded).

I was able to get a ticket to fly, and I am hoping that my country does not continue the ban on the flights leaving my country to go to his. I checked with my country's immigration and his, and I am allowed to pass through. I am able to get a ticket to leave by the end of this month (our flights are banned until next week).

I am required to do self-isolation when I arrive and I am arranging this as well, to stay at an apartment by myself for 14 days before I actually go to him. I can only see him until after quarantine, which is mid-June. In my home country I have been working from home since 6th March and only go out for groceries once every two weeks. I have been in the midst of planning and the advice I am receiving from family and friends are half saying to go, half saying to stay and wait. 

On the one hand, I really really want to be able to help my husband recover and I know that there is already a lot of emotional stress with the situation so I want to give him support, besides care, during this time that he is in recovery. He has his parents and siblings who can help him, but it is simply not the same having your spouse to give you emotional support. At the same time, I almost lost him once, I am not going to sit so far away idly waiting out this pandemic before I do something to help him. He needs me and I should be where he is. 

On the other hand, there is also a huge personal health risk by taking a 12-hour closed in flight, and we know how this virus is easily caught indoors and in enclosed spaces. I am fairly healthy (I don't smoke, I used to swim/exercise 3 times a week before lockdown, I don't have a compromised immune system) but there are still risks. My husband is also fearful of me catching the virus, and if in the chance that I do get it, I am not covered by my insurance from back home or travel insurance.   I am also afraid of increasing his anxiety and emotional stress should I ever catch the virus. 

My mind is set on going until I had a talk with a family member who said that the risk is really too great especially if I get the virus and I am alone and in self-isolation in a different country. There is also the other risk of being out in the open when I have to go back home (I have not asked immigration yet if they can extend my stay further, but I do have a PR application).

If this helps, I'd like to add a few more details: I already have a permanent residency application in place, until covid has put a delay on the processing. We do not know when the approval will come, because work is most likely halted on it. My work is in the field of IT and can be done from home. I asked my boss if they could allow me the flexibility of working from another country as long as I kept the same hours (so I will be working nights), and I was allowed. 

I'm stuck. If my husband had anything happen to him and I am not there to support him, I will never forgive myself. If I ever do get to his city and then I catch the virus and give him additional stress (or omg so much worse, transmit the virus to him), I will also never forgive myself. The best possible scenario is of course me not catching the virus and everything will be fine, but I do not know that, too. 

He is currently on the way to recovery, he had an infection but he is getting better. He is able to walk and be independent but he gets tired very easily. It will take about 6 weeks til he can push, pull, or carry things and he needs to be on a strict, heart-healthy diet. His mom and his sister are nurses who are able to look after him. 

I guess I only wrote here because I don't know where else to turn to. I don't want to burden people by talking about all these to them and I don't know if they will understand. I find myself crying suddenly at times or unable to do work due to anxiety and it is difficult to cope. 

I would appreciate advice or any other words, really. Thank you.",2020-05-13 02:18:01

My boyfriend (21) and I (20) are both students living with our families during quarantine. We have not seen each other in over two months. 

Tomorrow my boyfriend is planning on going up to his lake house in NH with his brother, and wants to stop by my home on the way. Neither of us are sick or have symptoms and both our families have been quarantining and taking social distance measures very seriously. However, my boyfriends father is an essential worker (liquor store) and his brother has been visiting friends for 6-feet apart type hangouts. 

My boyfriend is from a suburb outside New York City and I am in a very rural part of Massachusetts. Everyone in my family has not left the house for the entirety of quarantine except twice for groceries. I have an extremely anxious family (myself included) but my father is especially sensitive to health related issues. Both my parents have agreed that my boyfriend can visit, but my father was reluctant. 

I have been struggling with this isolation since the start of quarantine, but the last week I have been slipping in and out of depressive episodes. I feel so hopelessly lonely and disconnected from all the people I love. In all selfish honesty, I want to see my boyfriend more than anything in the world even if it’s just for a couple of hours. I want to be able to hug him and hold his hand and put my head on his shoulder. If no contact would be better, I could do it, but I really want to see him with physical contact. 

Do you think this is too big of a risk? Is this breaking social distancing measures in a potentially dangerous way? I am always going to put the health and safety of others over my personal needs. If I got my family sick I could never live with myself. I want to do the right thing, but I also want to see my boyfriend who I miss horribly and who seeing would drastically improve my mental health, which at the moment is very poor.

860,Online Classes Suck,19,gi2dda,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gi2dda/online_classes_suck/,4,"TL;DR at bottom

(TW/CW, feelings of depression and worthlessness)

Thank you for approving me, sorry if this is a bit soon...

I dunno, man. Just wanna vent a bit. You know those ""Zoom Classes"" memes? Yea, sadly I can't relate, our structure is currently ""drop all the weekly assignments onto our class site for you to sort out yourself, good luck"". I feel so unmotivated and depressed that I don't even do it until the like the night before, or sometimes starting the night before that, cramming it all in at the last minute and getting good grades. Sounds good, eh? Still passing? Well, it's still mental torture. I barely even get up to eat or drink cause I'm so freaking miserable and irritable. I hate this format, I do way better in-person on the teacher's schedule. I feel like I'm being held responsible for what I do. ""My own pace"" is at their pace, and with this new format I just can't seem to get it right. I even tried to do my assignments on our old schedule to feel normal but my idiot brain decided that was too much to focus on, but the same 5 YouTube channels?? Needs more attention that my own health, man. Today is literally the last day of class and I have so many things to do. I just failed one class that I consistently kept up before because I didn't turn my final essay in or take part in the class discussion, which tanked my grade by like 15-20 points. Another I was already struggling in because I barely absorb anything I read as-is (I have one last mandatory test I didn't study for), and another I didn't do my second to last assignment, and I'm so close to just saying ""screw it, I'm not doing this."" because I jus't can't get it right. My mom says she just wants me to get a passing grade since she understands the struggle, and I don't know if I could admit to failing at least two so spectacularly.

I did go through some BS, on top of this format not being my thing, my grandfather died of COVID-19 at the beginning of April, and my aunt on my dad's side died from something unknown last week (I was absolutely wreaked after losing my grandfather, but I was closer to my aunt mostly just when I was younger, so I didn't react too much. My mom says that her loss might just be in the back of my mind, like ""there, but not all consuming"".) I also have Diabetes, which is terrifying since I'm not used to keeping track of it. I'm also not the most mentally stable person around. I knew this would affect me in some way, but I don't ever wanna see any of that as my excuse to give up. But at the same time I feel like absolute shit, I haven't felt this hopeless in years. I'm an adult, 18 years old and in college, but I'm about to lose it. I wanna hope for the future and one day look back to see this as just another bump in the road, but I feel like such a monumental idiot. I wanna one day make cartoons with my stories and characters (which I love more than life itself), and take care of my family for the rest of or lives, that's literally the only thing keeping me together, but would anybody even take me seriously?? I'm so pissed at EVERYTHING, COVID-19, the people in charge, myself for failing so bad, just EVERYTHING. I dunno what to do at this point, I'm a lost cause, I just hope I don't disappoint my mother. I love college, I wanna be here to experience all that it has to offer, and I still have high-hopes for the rest of my college experience. But... like, is there still a point of staying if I flunk this semester?

&#x200B;

TL;DR, I'm a community college student currently failing some of my classes during this final crunch, and I'm thinking of giving up and just failing the other one too, as if I no longer exist. I'm sad to be a disappointment to my mom, although I feel like she wouldn't be too hard on me. Does anyone else feel this way? If so, do you have hope that next semester will be better?",2020-05-12 06:38:52

For example, a patient came in today and was coughing a lot in the room. Granted, she had a mask on and we wear them too. I let him  know this and he said, ""coughing isn't a sign of it, if she has it we all have it.""

What?? When I told him I was just informing him of the fact, he said he'll always say something to try and ""calm me down."" On top of that when he went into the room he didn't have his mask on. When he ""cleans"" down the tables he just sprays the cleaner on it and leaves it. I end up going behind him to spray AND wipe the table down. That is a lot of work between everything else I do at the front desk along with letting people in and out of the office. I'm honestly angry at him and now understand why a lot of people don't trust this profession.

Friendship ender or am I overreacting?,59,ghqgou,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ghqgou/best_friend_chooses_to_take_a_risk_with_someones/,89,"I’ll start at the beginning. About a month ago, my best friend (lets call him Thomas) tells me he thinks his wife has Covid-19. She’s exhibited two of the major symptoms of the virus - sustained shortness of breath and a fever for multiple days in a row. The shortness of breath was so bad she could barely utter a word. I agreed she most likely had Covid-19 based on the symptoms. (She has no prior history of asthma, or anything which could have been a previous symptom of shortness of breath). I said his wife should stay isolated in a separate room in the house, with no contact from the otherwise healthy family members. Thomas has three children, so he was taking care of the kids, doing all the housework, schooling, working from home and taking care of his wife, cleaning, sanitizing, plus making all the food, etc… Definitely a lot to handle for one person considering we have to shelter in place, but it’s what had to be done.

They called her doctor to let them know about what was going on and were advised to stay home unless it became more serious. This is what they did, except for one outing she did by herself. She wanted to get a test to see if it was Covid-19 and made an appointment on Day 3. She drove down to the testing center, only to be turned away after additional screening because she hadn’t had contact with anyone who had tested positive. At least not that she knew of anyway. She drove home to continue her self-isolation. Her symptoms continued for a total of five days before starting to get better. Her breathing became much better and the fever subsided. I was happy for her, that she was feeling better, but not out of the woods by any means.

In the middle of this, two days into his wife’s symptoms becoming better, Thomas told me he was going to leave the house to meet a client. I was quite shocked by this. I explained your wife is presumed to have Covid-19 and it’s only been a couple days. You have a moral obligation to stay home and isolate for at least two weeks. He said work was light and he was worried about not being able to provide for his family. (His family is not near running out of money by any means.) I said there are bigger issues at stake here. His wife most likely has it and he could be asymptomatic. It’s not a chance to take lightly, especially with someone else life. He could unknowingly infect his client, as well as their family. He started crying on the phone, caught between a rock and a hard place. He said he was going to take every precaution, stay six feet away, wear a mask and gloves. I told him there was no guarantee he could be 100% safe. Since his wife was presumed positive, he should isolate as well. He didn’t want to hear anymore about it, so we had to end the conversation.

We didn’t speak again until two weeks after his client meeting. I couldn’t bring myself to even speak to him during that time. I view this as a moral issue, potentially putting someones life at risk and possibly killing them or causing them health issues. When we finally did speak on the phone, we got into it heavy and hard. It was the worst conversation we have ever had. Words were said and no side budged. He saw this as me not trusting his judgement, not supporting his best friend. I saw this as a moral issue with potential life changing decisions. I mean, I never ever expected this kind of behavior from him. After things got heated, we hung up. We went back and forth via text for the few days. He ended up wanting to get the last word (after continuing to try and get me to agree he did the right thing), and then said let’s agree to disagree. Not the outcome I really wanted.

Am I wrong to be thinking this way? Am I being too hard on him? Should I have been more understanding or trusting? I’m not sure I can, or want to, move past this. This is supposedly my best friend. I hold him to a much higher standard than other people. Hell, I think it’s a basic standard I would hold anyone to. Lets keep each other safe. I never thought in a million years I’d be debating with him why it’s important to not take risks/chances with someone else life. That you can’t be 100% certain of safety. Is this, or should this be, a dealbreaker? He was my best friend, I’m just not to certain I know who this person is anymore.

(As a follow up, the wife did get the antibody test and it came out negative. (Of course it could be a false result, or he could be lying to me.) He also said his client was healthy. But damn, this is after the fact.…..)",2020-05-11 20:08:45

All well and good until we get in an argument and she uses the same old threat to throw me back in my old village-like town with no future guaranteed(Not really, i study science and going for A level and such doesn't exist where i am from, meaning i have to re-live my past 2-3 years again if i was thrown back which is not good for my young age.)The problem is, i am beyond scared. Because of the numerous times of going outside with her to 'accompany her' to the shop, or take the public transport to somewhere just to 'have a fresh breath of air', i started to suspect i had mild symptoms of sore throat, that doesn't go away, and slight shortness of breath. It has been roughly 4 days, i can still run and exercise just fine but, i noticeably started to yawn way more and cough at least once a day to clear my throat. Not only that, at the nights i start to use my mouth to breath in air like 7/10 of the time. I haven't brought it up to her since i'd just know she'd kind off brush it off since she knows i can easily get sick if its cold. You know, type of people that always sneeze in colder temperature... But it's worrying if this 'cold' doesn't go away.

I apologise for my little rant, it certainly helps me calm down at least a bit, since i am in stressful position because grades were given off 'Expected grades' which will cause trouble for applying to places i wanted. Also i just wanted a few reassuring words, since i used to be a shoulder for people to cry on in Discord, but it is nice to rant a bit myself at times. Hope you all the best.

My post master keep warning me / threatening me that if i dont come back before the 12 weeks i will be let go and that ""if the rest of the year you have to take FMLA its for the full year"". What they dont know is iv been using this time to look for a new job and work on my resume. I realized how much i hate the job when i dont have to drag myself there everyday. So I live in Iowa right now and have been on unemployment, I had to fight for it because the PO auto rejects any application, if i meet that 12 weeks and am let go do i still receive the unemployment?

""So-and-so Friday, these other two people Saturday, how about I see what these other two are up to for Sunday, etc."" But then I was thinking... ""Wait a second, are you sure this is okay?"" Frankly, I'm not sure. My Dad (has like 4 risk factors) has been going out daily since this started and flouting the rules basically, and for more than two months nothing has happened to him. At this point, I'm starting to kind of think ""It will probably be fine if we don't go to concerts or something, wear a mask, and sanitize/wash hands a lot.""

My anxiety is becoming barely manageable (2hr workouts only softened it) and I need to find a new place to live in the near future. Add to that some pretty deep seated family issues, living with my ex-boyfriend that I broke up with two months ago and feeling deeply touch starved I just feel so hopeless. I am currently in therapy which helps for a day or two before the existential dread comes back.

Everything looks so bleak. I don't have many friends and the ones I do have are difficult to talk to because they are understandably negative. I was just starting to dip my toes back into dating when the shut downs happened and although I have made a few connections I worry that there's no point if we are going to be social distancing until next year.

I've gotten a prescription for Levaquin for antibiotic for ten days, and a Albuterol inhaler to take every four hours/as needed/before bed. I was skeeved out going to Walmart to pick up the prescription but it is what it is. ;)**

*Update (third day): Feeling much better. Probably was/is a bad sinus infection. I got up and I'm dressed! Been taking Emergen C, Mucinex, Elderberry syrup, orange juice, vitamin D, C, and various tinctures. I also have been taking a couple of different H2/H3 blockers just in case it was Covid19.

870,Any Survivor Stories From People With High BMI?,22,ghe14k,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ghe14k/any_survivor_stories_from_people_with_high_bmi/,21,"Hi everyone. I'm a 33 year old male with a high BMI (was over 50 BMI, now a little above 40). I suffered from a misdiagnosis of COPD last year, which caused me to give up smoking and really get serious about losing weight. It's been a year and a few months, and I've lost 85 pounds (still working on it!). The whole episode left me with a really, really bad case of health anxiety that I have been dealing with slowly but surely.

I was doing really well until COVID-19 hit the scene. I am an academic, so I like to stay up to date on the research and data. And the grim outlook for people with high BMIs is really setting off the health anxiety triggers. What has helped me with that is watching and reading survivor stories. It fills me with a sense of ""if they can recover, I can too if I get it"". And since I live in a big city, I worry a lot about catching it. 

Anyway, like I said, survivor stories have really helped me to combat my anxieties, but I haven't been able to locate a lot of survivor stories from people with a high BMI. Which of course only feeds into the idea that if I catch the virus it's a death sentence, which I know is just my anxiety talking, but still. 

I know all of the logic. With such high levels of percentages of obesity in America, if it were a death sentence, then the amount of casualties would be massive. I know just through logic that there must be obese people that recover. But I know myself, and I know that hearing that from someone who actually survived it would mean the world to me.

So please. If you're comfortable sharing, I'd love to hear from you. Especially since I know there must be others out there like me, scared half to death, and just wanting to know that there are others like me who have survived, and I can too.

Thank you.",2020-05-11 05:24:59

It was unexpected. My grandpa and I grabbed our masks and put them on and I asked him if he wanted to talk to her through the door (glass) and he said no. I told him letting her in wasn't safe but he didn't want to talk to her through the door. 

I left it up to him and part of me wanted to see her too because we have been isolation for so fucking long now. Only going to the grocery store. I have even put stuff off because I have had drainage at night that made my throat sore and gave me a cough. My hands are so dry from washing and using hand sanitizer... And I'm lonely. I've only been texting my fiance. I just desperately need interaction outside of a damn phone. 

I went to the bathroom and when I came back, she was sitting on the couch, keeping distance from grandpa and she was wearing a mask. We all were. 

I sat down across the room but then decided to move everyone outside because it was a nice day and it is safer. I read about how air flow disperses any droplets and makes it harder to get enough viral load to become infected. 

We enjoyed the visit from my mom and I honestly feel like it improved my mental health a bit (I've had severe depression), but now I feel bad because I broke quarantine by letting her in... 

I posted here before about giving up social distancing because no one else in my county is doing it at all (or masks). I feel like cattle when shopping because people just gather around me without a care. 

I will still wear my mask, but honestly, if I'm going to get Covid (likely) I want to get if from people I give a shit about. I just don't want to make others sick by not at the very least wearing a mask. I can't really help if they get close to me, though. They're making their own choice. 

I hope everyone is having a happy mother's day. All is bitter sweet. A catch 22. Best of luck to you all.",2020-05-10 22:28:43

They are both mid 60s, but both of them are in the at risk group. They live a few hours away from me.

My mother is in the extreme at-risk group, as she is currently being treated for a very serious lung problem that began back in December. It feels like it was a perfect storm, she got sick with some bacterial infection deep in her lung and now has a lung drain tube that must be drained of fluid buildup every single day. She is also on home oxygen and long-term antibiotics, and her doctor suspects she may have a form of blood cancer that caused all this but cannot seek any further tests or clinic-based treatment until it is safer out. Besides an occasional cough, she was previously very healthy before this started so it's a shock that she got so sick so fast.

My father is a health care worker (Ear/Nose/Throat doctor) who's office shut down weeks ago, coincidentally right around the time when my mom began needing him to stay home more to take care of her. He has been cooking for my mom, helping with her lung drain and medications, and taking care of all household duties. He also has a heart condition.

Every single day, I wake up terrified out of my mind that they will catch the virus. Every day. When they call or text me, I am mortified that it is to tell me that one of them has developed a fever or doesn't feel good. Every morning I wake up sick to my stomach with worry until I hear from them and hear that they are okay for another day. 
I've read these horror stories of families getting torn apart from this virus, older couples dying within days of each other, just absolute nightmares and I feel completely trapped with the idea that it could happen to my sweet parents. Even though they are being very very careful and haven't gone out at all (besides my dad getting groceries w/ mask/gloves), my dad will have to return to work soon. In his profession, he is very at risk of the virus because of how close he gets to his patient's faces. If he brings it home to my mom, it would just be horrible with the state her lungs are in.

Some background, she works with less then ten people and keeps clean, she doesn’t live alone but regardless I still just wanted her to stay put for her own safety.

I live in an apartment with 3 other roommates, who are friends I have had for many years. Sometime in March when people in my state starting taking the virus seriously, my roommate became sick with the virus.  I ended up moving back in with my mother, and was able to safely isolate from her until I knew I was not infected.

I have been taking this very seriously because I am now living with my elderly mother who is high risk.  I just recently went to the grocery store for the first time in 2 months! It's not an ideal situation by any means but I felt extremely unsafe at my apartment.  My issue now is my roommate has fully recovered and none of the 3 are taking this seriously at all.

I see them post all over social media that they are partying at people's homes in large groups.  No masks. They are inviting people to our apartment to drink/hangout.  The more I see this the more angry I get.  I would like to move back in.  We live in an expensive community and I'm still paying a large amount of money in rent to essentially store my belongings.  I have tried to talk to them about this and they say they understand but haven't made any changes.  They said they would be fine not having people at the apartment, but are unwilling to agree that they will not go to other peoples homes.

I shut my business down (a food trailer) last week to self-quarantine after I got some gnarly symptoms which ended up probably being an asthma flare up. I got tested, and the test came back negative. I'm feeling better now.

But, I'm alarmed by how fucking stupid everyone is being. And I'm alarmed at our insane jumps in case count and I'm mortified and depressed over how much death has come about because of this.

These covidiots out here are convinced it's a hoax, it's not real and are celebratory in not wearing masks and following the guidelines. The only thing I can think and feel is that I hope that they're the correct ones in this situation. That I'm the dumbass, I'm overreacting and that this thing will just go away. I want to feel that kind of certainty.

I say all that to say this: given what we know so far about this virus and the projections for it, if these people are wrong all along...then what we're about to experience is one of the darkest times we'll have gone through in living memory. It's going to be a reality that I don't think anyone is prepared to face. And my major fear is that it won't be a slow burn. It's going to drag us like an undertow that you can't escape.

I have a son coming in September. I don't want to try and contemplate what the United States will be like by then.",2020-05-10 10:46:57
883,Anyone else dealing with parents wanting you to break quarantine?,24,ggssok,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ggssok/anyone_else_dealing_with_parents_wanting_you_to/,6,"Looking for support or advice on how others have dealt with stuff like this. My parents are taking my lack of visits due to quarantine very personally. They've been getting on my case to come home since all this started, but they've been calling and texting me the past couple days a lot. I've told them I don't want to take the risk to visit them, and they responded by telling me they don't know why they've bothered to help pay for my education and that they don't deserve to be ""treated like this"" (for context, I'm 21 and just finished a semester of online uni courses).

Both of us live in pretty affected areas, theirs moreso than mine. None of us are showing symptoms and we've all been social distancing to the best of our ability, but there are certain things neither of us can avoid (work, grocery trips, roommates, etc.). The person who lives in the apartment next to mine said he was feeling sick, I know other people on my floor have been travelling and going out and we all share the same washer and dryer. To be honest, I don't know what my roommate has been up to, even though I like to think she's pretty responsible.

Ironically, they're the ones at the greatest risk if they were to get sick, yet they're insisting I come home. It feels like they're asking me to shoot an apple off their head. Not to mention if I came back home afterwards, I would still be interacting with my roommate and someone at high risk I've been bringing groceries to on occasion. I can handle taking risks where I'm the only one who would be affected by the consequences, but putting the people I care about at risk is more than I can handle.

I feel terrible for not seeing them. I've been planning for mother's day since before quarantine started (tried to grow her some flowers, but my thumb is not that green lol) and there are some birthdays coming up as well. But I can barely sleep at night now, and I definitely wouldn't be able to knowing that I might have gotten them sick.

Their mentality seems to be ""we'll have to break quarantine eventually so you might as well do it now"".   They don't understand how the virus works and they're taking risks because THEY'RE fine with it, even when it's a risk to others.

It's just frustrating. I have a lot on my own plate, and I don't know how to deal with this. I haven't been calling them as much because they try to guilt me into coming home every time, then they think that means I don't care about them.

How have you all been dealing with this? I know I'm not the only one.",2020-05-10 06:07:44

My wife kept telling me it was just anxiety and to not worry but, I know something is wrong. I get she was just afraid. 

Well official diagnosis is viral pneumonia. Dr is confident its covid and my test results will be back on Monday. They literally rushed me out and gave me orders to come back when it gets worse. I'm so lost and scared. My kids and wife need me but I feel helpless. I can barely stay awake for more than an hour at a time I'm just so exhausted. Right now I'm quarantined in the basement.. I can hear my kids and family but can't see them, its torture.. I just don't know what to expect. 

I've been so incredibly careful but went back to work last week. Even there I always wore an N95, bleached all contact surfaces and kept distance. Most work was all outdoors. All our grocery deliveries have been disinfected before bringing them in the house. So so so careful.

UPDATE!: Got a call yesterday from the same dr with my covid test results. NEGATIVE!! Dr says very unlikely a false negative and no idea what is causing the pneumonia and symptoms. Follow up with PCP. 

Today appointment with PCP who after reading results thinks may be a false negative. The joy is short lived. Woke up today feeling worse and now with some stomach issues and a sore throat. PCP says suck it up and be strong. Call if breathing gets worse or fever gets high. 

Well, things just went downhill. Not for me. One of my twin 20 month olds spiked a fever of 103. No choice but to take him to urgent care. ;(

Mom, a teacher, has hardly left the house. Stepdad still has had to work. He runs a convenience store. I guess I should say they're in a small town in Kansas that hasn't been affected much. Still, he's taken precautions. Plexiglas between cashier and customer, gloves, constant cleaning - all of it. Since he's been going out, he and my mom are keeping distance from each other this whole time. Honestly, impressive resilience. 
My brother and his family have not been cautious. At all. Continuing with vacation plans in early April, and hosting friends visiting from out of state, among other things. I know where he gets his news, and so as not to alienate anyone in particular, I'll just say that in my opinion, his sources aren't reliable.
So, this morning I call mom, and she says he had invited her and stepdad to an outside bbq, which they attended, doing the best they could to maintain social distancing. In my opinion, that's already an unnecessary risk. But, to top it off, he hadn't told her about his and his family's social indiscretions, and talked her into taking his 3 kids, her grandchildren, home overnight. So, they're there now. 
It's been so difficult to stay away from friends and family through this, but my wife and I, have been doing it. My mom and stepdad have been trying so hard.  I feel like my brother and his reckless, misinformed actions have made it all a waste. I don't know what I'll do if my wonderful parents get needlessly infected. I don't know what I'll say to him.

I mean I get it people have it more rough than me out there. The doctors, homeless people. poor people, etc. It still doesn't mean that people who are suffering less should still have feelings too.  


Anyways back to my point on this post. I am starting to feel this pandemic taking over me in a bad way. All the self isolation, the fear of the unknown after the pandemic is over, having your career choices severely decreased because of the virus. When you are hit with all this uncertainty all at once it's really depressing. I know some people will have an issue with how  this coronavirus is affecting me personally but I don't care anymore. I am sick of worrying about how people judge me on how I am taking this whole pandemic issue. I want to come out and say how I am starting to get depressed because of this because I know if I keep my feelings bundled up it's just going to keep getting worse.  


This whole thing is just really getting to me now. From not being able to see a lot of my loved ones to not having a place of my own yet. I can feel myself getting more upset each day that passes. Ontop of that I worry about the aftermath of the pandemic. We could be hit with multiple waves of this crap for a long time. It's only a matter of time I feel like before states just give up and declare Martial Law and things get even more worse.

On the one hand my state is opening up for before we are ready, but I suppose I am “lucky” in some ways that my company has assured us we can continue to work from home until the end of the year.

The problem is the reopening has my panic worse than it’s been almost this entire time except for maybe when this first started. I’ve been quarantined for 9 weeks now only leaving for walks in my neighborhood and a monthly essential doctor appointment. I’m completely alone (no roommate, SO, even pets) and live across the country from most of my family and friends as I had only moved here slightly before all this started.

More and more I’m hearing well life may go back to normal for most people but vulnerable populations may have to continue isolating. As a vulnerable population this makes me incredibly depressed. Sure this isolation hasn’t been easy but I think one of the few things making it bearable is knowing that everyone is in the same boat. Thinking about others being able to go back to normal and still feeling so stuck and isolated just makes me spiral into depression.

That said: has anyone ever had allergies that made your chest hurt/burn like it's dry and lungs feel like they're rattling, even if not audibly? I'm trying to calm myself down that I don't have Covid.

I have no trouble breathing, no fever, only 3-4 mild coughs a day (nothing persistent), and my pulse-ox is normal. Other than the chest pain I feel fine. I'm 28 and overweight, but not ""morbidly"" so. I've been social distancing for 56 days, and the handful of times I've had to go outside I've worn a mask. I wash my hands religiously and disinfect everything before it comes inside, but I've had a couple close mask-less brushes with people in my apartment hallway (although I try to hold my breath).

I (28 with asthma) live with my husband (30 and healthy) and mother in law (69 with plenty of pre existing conditions). MIL is super cautious about this stuff but sometimes she just isn't smart about it.

She orders groceries every single week even though the fridge and pantry are totally stocked. She wipes them all down when they come in but what she was doing before was just mixing a random amount of bleach and water for that. She reuses the same gloves everytime the groceries come and then washes her hands for lole 5 seconds. She also goes out there without a mask right after the delivery driver was out there without a mask, the CDC has stated the virus can live in the air for up to 2hrs and shes out there within 2 minutes.

She recently had friends over for some ""social distancing in the yard"" and not a single one of them wore a mask. There was also a child running around who was definitely not keeping a full 6 feet.

She went to a friends house recently for some help with her new at home job. She said she wore a mask but the masks we have are just home made cloth masks and no one else in the house was wearing one. The thing is this friend has not done a single thing to prevent this virus. He goes out every chance he gets, just last week before she went to his house he had gone to a drive in theater and sat outside his car with some friends who have been religiously going to the beach. When she came home she changed her clothes, washed her hands and called it a day...

She acts so aftaid of this, putting her mail in bags to sit for days and disinfecting everything but then she just does things that almost make all of that not matter. We weren't living with her before the pandemic, we only came here because she was going stir crazy living alone. I almost regret coming here but at the same time our living situation before was not safe. We lived in a very active campground where no one was taking it seriously and everyone was regularly throwing parties. Also our plot was about 3ft away from the dog walking area where people constantly go and just hack a lung out (usually from smoking but who knows right now)

Weve been here for a month but i feel like our isolation is ""reset"" like every week because of these things. Im sure i could be over reacting but she is eisking her life and also mine everytime she leaves the house. Im already sick right now, i have been for almost 3 weeks. Its all GI related and ive already tested negative for Covid about a week ago but i cant get to a dr right now withiut risking my life so im probably going to continue to be sick for a while (im not 100% sure whats going on, i know it was gastritis for a while but some symptoms point to it maybe being more serius than that) and while im sick i feel like im even higher risk than i am already with my asthma.

When i came down sick before i disnt even bother isolating myself because she just kept coming into the room and chatting with us anyways, plus her and my husband were very convinced i not have covid and decided to treat me as such. To be fair ive been isolating for almost 3 months. But every grocery and package delivery is a chance to catch it.

She truly is a lovely person and i know she means the best with everything she does but we're stuck living here with no jobs and i just dont feel safe anymore. We live in an area that hasnt been hit insanely hard but still has about 600 confirmed cases for a population of 300,000 people, which is less than 1% of the population being sick but that doesnt mean we should take this lightly.

• eat a easy healthy breakfast; light protein and lots of veggies, 4 servings of fruit or veggies.

• Do a body weight exercise for 15- 30mins,  gym memberships are a money pit anyway. (Look on YouTube, I do a ""Yoga Dose"" then a ""OfficialThenX"" work out myself)

• you daily morning hygiene routine by 9am; shower, shave, so on. (I do about 7am)

•Work hard at something, anything, from 8-12. (Might try learning or major home improvement if you can't work.)

• Set a alarm to drink a glass of water every hour or so, it's just good for you.

•try to get 10 servings of fruits and vegetables a day.

• look up your body weight and figure out how much water you're supposed to take in, then try to do that every day with little tiny reminders here and there to drink.

• Only buy healthy snacks; pears, apples, nuts bananas. You'll eat junk if it's there.

• Eat a very light lunch, half salad or vegetarian soup. Say 2-4 servings of fruit and veggies.

•The walk out in the sun for a 10-15 minutes after lunch, (no sunglasses, light fights minor depression from being shut in).

• spend about a half-hour to a hour light reading every day; magazine, fun novel, so on. (Backpacker magazine, Orion magazine, or the Cincinnati Review is my go to)

•Get back to work if you can for 3 hours. If you can't work from home, tinker or learn something new... you might try learning yoga or oil painting

• TV is the enemy (it eats your day, but also your reality in someway... Everything is just going through the motions... It makes you depressed)

• limit news to about 1 hour a day, and 2 hours one day a week, maybe Sunday. (It will consume you, if you let it, trust me.)

• garden about 3 hours a week if you can. (Indoor pots let anyone have a green thumb)

• Eat a elaborate prepared, but well portioned and healthy dinner... ESPECIALLY if you live alone, fights ""lonely, don't care, eating whatever"". Make making food art.

• after dinner clean, every dish, every thing you made dirty. (Wednesday I clean whole place, takes about 3 hours)

• if you work from home work another hour or two after walk, if not read a novel.

• learn to makes or tinker on something useful not just puzzles; knit, sew, wood carve, tinker on broken machines.

• read a chapter a day; fiction or nonfiction, doesn't matter.

• set a time of day you call or text a friend.

• have a market day

I’m a 20 year old college student and I just finished my spring semester around a week ago. I lost my job due to the pandemic, live 600 miles away from my family, and have struggled with mental health issues for years. As I’m sure many of you can relate, I’ve never felt this bad.

I feel like I’ve lost all sense of meaning in my life. I don’t have any goals to strive for because everything is up in the air. I’m supposed to graduate early this December, but I’m unsure if classes will even continue in the fall if the situation doesn’t improve. I’m a student studying the music industry, which is already an uncertain field that relies on internships and experience. I have spent the last summers doing these internships and making meaningful connections that would help me in my career. However, there’s no chance of doing that this summer.

I’m just unsure where to go from here. I am without a job, finished with school for the summer, and without internship and career opportunities. My house lost power due to a storm this past week for 4 days which made the situation even worse.

I hate to sound whiny and pessimistic, but I’m so lost right now. I feel stuck. I’m not getting out of bed unless I have to. I’m neglecting my needs and I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt so depressed. If anyone has any words of advice I would appreciate it so much.

I'm writing this because even though I was fine and positive when all this Covid thing started, I'm losing my motivation day by day.

I know am very lucky, privileged to live in a safe place, with my fav people. That I have access to essentials, for now. But off late I have started worrying more and more about the future. Earlier, I was positive and quite calm with whatever happened. But now that I can't see any end to this, I'm losing my hope, day by day. 

I sometimes get anxiety and then instead of thinking up activities for my kid, I just Netflix all day. 

We can't even go out, we are only allowed to go down to the lobby for deliveries. Only people with health issues (physiotherapy or autistic kid) are allowed to walk in the gardens etc. 

My husband got a transfer in his job and we are expected to move after lockdown ends in India. But I'm worried about changing my kids school in the middle of all this, and of finding a new rental apartment in the new city. Societies (gated communities) here are quite strict and authoritarian, so I'm also worried that they may decide to not let any new people rent. That wouldn't have been possible earlier, but with COVID, who knows? Plus my kid.. not only will they have to deal about leaving old friends - without a proper farewell - but there may not be any new play dates or friends anytime soon. And we don't know if or when schools will open.

Having read through many of the posts on this subreddit for the past few months, I wanted to make you guys something to help bring a little light to your day. With 200+ videos to its name, the ""For You"" playlist covers a wide spectrum, from moments that make you proud to be human, to showcases of incredible inventions, creativity, and ingenuity, to a cat in a shark suit riding a Roomba. I intend to keep adding videos until it totals 24 hours, so I can give you guys a literal day's worth of reasons to smile, to laugh, to be inspired, and to hope.  

Below is a link to the playlist. There's a lot to choose from, so my advice would be to pick a video with a title and/or thumbnail that interests you most, and go from there. Otherwise, just start from the beginning and let the good times roll!

Although I self isolated from March 23ish to April 27th (went back to work), and although the first known case didnt occur til early march in my state, I've been wondering if I just caught it and had it asymptomatically.

After all, around late January-mid February, my grandparents both got sick with fever, lethargy, cough (and the cough lasted, like, months...). Shortly after that, my siblings all had coughs that lasted for weeks, but they're all 10 and under and that was their only symptom.

I wonder if, at some point, it's likely I contracted it and just didnt display symptoms. I dont plan on dropping my precautions at all (sanitizing EVERYTHING when I get home, wearing a mask at work even when on break, immediately showering when I get home, etc) but I think it would just sort of maybe comfort me to know that I couldve had it already.

I dont plan on getting it at all, and I'm taking every precaution against it. But, in my mind, getting it and not knowing would be much better than getting it and having the symptoms. For my own mental health's sake.",2020-05-08 20:36:01

She tested negative for COVID thankfully, but they've found vegetation on her mitral valve in her heart, abscesses in her knee and ankle, pneumonia, positive blood cultures, and they're going to MRI her brain to see if the infection spread there. She's currently on a vent, and is set to have a mitral valve replacement on Monday, and neither me nor my father can be there for her, because of this pandemic. 

I worked at the same hospital last night on a different floor, so thankfully I got to peak in on her. I even got to go in her room for a minute after my awful shift and talk to her while she was intubated. She looked at me when I talked and told her of all the people who called to support her, and how we all missed her and hoped she would improve. And then after I left work, I broke down and cried like I haven't in decades. 

There's a chance she might die Monday. I might have been the last family face she sees before it happens. Not her husband of 30 years.  Not her sister. Not her great nephews who she thinks the absolute world of. Just me. Exhausted and on the verge of tears telling her to be strong. And even though it had to be me, I thank my lucky stars that she at least saw a familiar face, because it's a luxury that not many others can get in these times.

Both of our workplaces have implemented measures to minimize risk of exposure (issuing of masks, checking temperatures, issuing hand sanitizer, etc.) from both co-workers and members of the public and thus far neither of us has shown any signs of sickness; we also practice good hygiene and have not had close proximity contact in 7+ weeks.

My parents still go grocery shopping <=1 time/week and are seemingly healthy. Knowing all this, what are your thoughts on the two of us resuming normal relationship practices (cuddling, hugging, other close range activities) at this current stage of the outbreak?

My feelings towards all the ""we should NEVER go back to normal"" or ""this IS the new normal"" people is just -- ???????.

I'm a college student, living away from my parents, who is now jobless. I was working for my university, and was supposed to graduate next year. I had a great job in the IT department, and by the time I graduated would have had 3 years of IT experience to get a better job in a better city. My current city has very little jobs available because everything's closed or on limited operations. We're not LA or Silicon Valley, we're a little midwestern town. My only options are McDonald's and Walmart now.

My classes have moved online and I am failing 2 of them, a big change from A's and B's. My uni still has no concrete plans to get back to in-person schooling, and my job won't be back until ""maybe august"". OK but I need money!! I don't qualify for stimulus money because my parents claim me, and I don't qualify for unemployment.

Everyone else around me is like, elated to stay at home. They're happy to be on reduced hours, or staying at home and still getting paid. Even the friends who don't have jobs are having no issues. And god forbid I complain, because the same people are posting about how if you want things to change you're a piece of shit who is killing their grandma. Everyone's pressuring me to stick it out, but the odds of me getting my job and old life back are none if we'll be doing this ""off and on"" quarantine for the next 2 years like everyone's saying.

Idk I feel really depressed and angry! I'm skeptical that there will be economic support for my degree by the time I graduate, and if there is it will likely be ""work from home"" which I absolutely will not do. I can't continue studying/working/LIVING online, the instruction is abysmal and soooo not what I paid thousands of dollars for. I have to pay for rent, food, everything. I have parents and grandparents and a girlfriend too, who are at risk for covid-19. Plus I'm transgender, so I have to pay for my own medical care, and no I don't have family to support me. Sorry I don't have mommy and daddy to fall back on like every other unemployed/college 20's person seemingly does. But I'm the self centered piece of trash if I feel bad about this quarantine or wishing to at LEAST leave my house and enjoy the brief company of others to distract from the fact that my life is fucking broke and upended :)

I don't have a lot of needs. I'm an introvert, I'm frugal, and I had modest ambitions to get a house and start a family someday. But now I feel like it'll never happen, and I'm a horrible person for mourning that. I'm sorry this is such a downer I just can't stand seeing everyone so happy and unaffected by this. It makes me feel like I'm overreacting, and that I'm crazy for being skeptical that life will just magically repair itself in a month or two. The only person who shares this feeling is my girlfriend, she's an immuno-compromised person and SHE's broke and hopeless as well.

My family, as in parents and those younger siblings still living at home, have been going anywhere and everywhere it seems. My dad may be working at home now but he visits the home improvement store every day for supplies. My sister and mom went a trip an hour away to visit elderly friends and shop at a few stores. Masses are canceled but my brothers still went and sang in the choir for the online masses, and my parents sat in the front row of the church. this kind of stuff.

I politely said we should stay contactless for the duration of the stay home order and that it sucks. She didn't even bother replying - but got together with the rest of my siblings who have moved away from home. OK. OK. It sucks and I don't agree but it's their choice.

I have seven aunts and uncles and like thirty cousins on my moms side. They've all been seeing each other and going places and seeing their friends. But also they're being asses. about wearing masks or not (mandatory now in our state) and making jokes like ""gretchen didn't catch me."" it's childish. 

I found out that my aunt and cousins from states away came to visit my parents last weekend. What??  they didn't even try, it feels like?? And - Are they all seeing my grandma??? She lives across the street from my parents. I'm worried for her ugh

This morning in the family group chat I found out two of my siblings went on a road trip a few states away, to another state with a stay home order. Everyone just chatting like it's normal - yay they made it, looks like you all are having fun! And it's triggered a panic attack for me.

My husband got to spend 20 minutes with us after she was born before he had to go home for the night which was not how I planned bringing our baby into the world but I totally understand due to the pandemic, I'm just grateful he got to be there at all.

I have a very close family. Mum, Dad, Brother, SIL, Niece (8), nephew (6), Sister, BIL, Niece (8), Nephew (5). My Dad has been struggling, told me he doesn't feel like my new baby is his grand daughter. I know he wasn't trying to offend me but obviously I was upset. 

My toddlers behaviour has been terrible at times but I stead for being furious with her I have to remember her little world has been turned upside down. No seeing friends, no play groups, no park, no nursery school, no days with her nanna which she loves and no seeing her cousins. 

My Mum works for the NHS and goes into the hospital twice a week so I have no idea when I might be able to see her again.

928,This pandemic ruined a budding relationship and I just wanna rant about it,122,gevlaa,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gevlaa/this_pandemic_ruined_a_budding_relationship_and_i/,28,"Met a girl in late February. We started talking, basically nonstop. Felt like we were hitting it off. Mid-March, after some deliberation, I pushed the ""do we like each other"" issue. We did. After that, we hung out basically once before COVID came to the forefront and locked everything down. At first we said we were gonna try to make it work. She seemed as enthusiastic as I was. I was scared about being on lockdown for awhile and not seeing each other, but I wanted to make it work. I thought we could. Late March, I guess a switch flipped for her. Said she was scared of getting into a relationship due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, and she's also starting a stressful new job in mid-May and is afraid of what her availability will be. Legitimate concerns. I don't blame her. Things are stressful. We said that maybe we'll reconsider continuing it when things get back to normal (I feel like these kinds of things never pan out, but I suppose this is particularly weird time) and made promises to remain friends (which has gone about as well as you'd expect; we ping each other here and there but it's super awkward).

And she's right. I can't fault her. Trying to navigate a new relationship right now would suck. But having it ripped away from me sucks too. I really liked this girl and I feel like my chance of getting a fair shot was ripped away from me through no fault of my own. I struggle finding people I really connect with, and this stings. The timing has been comically bad. It's hard not to be furious about the situation.

If things were ""normal"", I would've been able to wallow in self-pity for a little bit, but then get back to normal life and do things to distract me. Now, I'm just stuck in a house and I've been totally unable to get this off of my mind. It's been awhile now so I don't really feel sad anymore, I just feel empty. I hate how nebulous everything feels. When can I see my friends again? When can I resume some semblance of normalcy? Is there actually going to be a time when I can attempt to rekindle this? Generally it helps me in life to pick something in the future and look forward to it, whether it's a big event or just hanging out with friends the next weekend or something. But with so much uncertainty it doesn't feel like I have anything to look forward to. It's just me, alone, working and killing time until I have to work again, indefinitely.

I consider myself overall lucky in this pandemic. I have a good job where I've just gone full WFH. I don't have economic concerns or anything. I'm lucky to be well off in this respect and I'm grateful for that. I still really hate this. I hate how I've had a potentially good thing ripped away from me, I hate how little control I have over my own life right now, and I hate how uncertain my future looks. I know it'll be fine, eventually, but while I'm doing my best to take a deep breath and ride this out, I still can't help but feel extremely frustrated. I just need to vent, I guess.",2020-05-07 03:52:45
929,Had a terrible dream last night about COVID,6,gf9db7,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gf9db7/had_a_terrible_dream_last_night_about_covid/,4,"Had a very vivid dream last night that I was walking through the entrance plaza at Disneyland, but I was wearing PPE and the place was 90% empty, which in Disneyland terms is ""fucking deserted"". Everyone was wearing a mask, and I was walking towards the entrance, but all I could think was how much I needed to run, that it wasn't safe, that at any time someone around me could drop dead. By the time I got to the front gate, I felt sick, like someone was forcing me to go in at gunpoint and knew this was a twisted way to kill me. I was looking at these happy children and families and watching them walk to their deaths.

I know it's a stupid thing to worry about and a lame thing to love, but I've been visiting the Disney parks frequently since I was a kid, and they're my #1 happy place and a source of most of my best memories. During every other personal or world-shaking crisis, I've gone with friends or family to distract myself. Now, I don't know if I'll ever really feel safe in one again. It felt like a particularly sick way for my subconscious to torture me - that something I loved and drew comfort from had now been irrevocably tainted and was killing people, just by existing, that it would never really be safe. I'm afraid that I'm never going to be able to enjoy any kind of public life again, even after we reopen safely, even years down the line when we have a vaccine, because all I'll be able to think is, where's the next pandemic? What if the person next to me in this theater or bar or line for a ride is patient zero? Going out in public is already starting to feel not like something I miss and want to do again, but something I miss in the abstract, something that's just not possible to do at all anymore, like people missing the time periods they grew up in that we've since grown past. It feels like I'll never see my friends in person again, that leaving the house was a funny quirk of the 20th century that will never be reinstated. I've been panicking and shaky all morning, and I don't know what to do.",2020-05-07 20:06:58

931,Very depressed about lockdown,25,geuh31,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/geuh31/very_depressed_about_lockdown/,12,"I have been in lockdown since mid-March in NYC and for these past two weeks, I have been very depressed about lockdown and feeling the social isolation and lack of hope. First, I have to acknowledge that I am one of the lucky ones -- I live with my partner and two cats and we both still have our jobs. Our apt has outdoor space. I have a good set of friends and we have been doing the whole video hang thing. And my family is safe and healthy even though we are not close. But more and more, I have been feeling lonely, sad and miserable about being in lockdown. I don't want to get into the nuances of why a video chat is not the same as an in personal interaction, but a zoom happy hour is not the same as going to happy hour at a bar with a group of friends. You know, when a few people show up and you first end up sitting in a circle but then more people arrive, people start standing, and groups splinter off. A hang in which you can huddle in a corner gossiping or in which someone can impromptu order shots. These virtual interactions can't replace the intimacy of the human touch or simply getting out of the house and feeling free of work/household chores/etc. Hell, I even miss going to the office and having stupid, petty small talk in the office kitchen. I miss getting onto a packed subway train and everyone rolling their eyes when someone holds the door open. I miss going to the gym and booking exercise classes. I miss all the small and beautiful things that made NYC the city I always wanted to live in and never leave.

It's gotten to the point where I am looking for any opportunity to go outside and possibly even see people in person. I know that the lockdown is the right thing to do and I support all of Cuomo's criteria for reopening NYC on a logical level. But the idea of not having NYC fully reopen until September or even next year makes me want to jump off a bridge. I believe in science and trust the advice of experts. But with the way I have been feeling, I am really, really inclined to break the rules and organize a small picnic in the park or have people over. It doesn't help that both my partner and I had COVID in March and probably have some immunity, even if not scientifically proven. I'm all the more frustrated because I believe that the federal government really fucked up, from not taking an active step in January to not simply locking the whole country down for 1.5 months so that we can reopen quicker and earlier. This article ([https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/stop-waiting-miracle/610795/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/stop-waiting-miracle/610795/)) summarizes how I am seeing this whole thing and if everything is so fucked and there is no hope, I just want to be selfish and feel better and I don't want to feel bad for doing it.

One hiccup is that a lot of my friends don't live near me or have left the city for lockdown. It means any meetup would require some subway travel to a mutually convenient location and the willingness of my friends, and I am just not sure who would be down or who wouldn't.

On top of this, I had been really, really looking forward to a 2.5 week international, multi-country vacation this year. I was in a very grueling graduate program for the past few years and graduated last year. I went straight into taking a very difficult licensing exam and then started my current job, which has been relentlessly demanding. This trip was the light at the end of my tunnel--a way for me to finally celebrate my graduation and to decompress fully from work. Now thanks to this pandemic, my travel plans are totally ruined. An inter-US trip may not be possible given the state of things and quarantine restrictions. And I seriously have no interest in doing a car road trip near NYC because I've seen a lot of it and I'm frankly just not interested in this part of the country anymore. So there is no light at the end of this tunnel, no friends or in-person hangouts to be had, and NYC may not even open its beaches. I understand logically and on an intellectual level that social distancing and locking is necessary to keep essential workers and the most vulnerable safe. I understand that medical workers are exhausted and need our help in flattening the curve. I am saddened by all the death. But I am also mentally losing it and don't know how to keep on. All I want is for some normalcy.",2020-05-07 02:49:01

I've been self-isolating to avoid exposure for 7 weeks--I get grocery delivery, wipe items down, and only go as far as walking to the mailbox or to take the trash out. Some days are awful, others aren't...just trying to stay calm. Yesterday was my birthday and I had some nice phone calls, etc. In the afternoon, my doorbell rang; I thought it was a delivery, so I waited a minute and then opened the door after I thought the person must have left. But it was 6 or 7 people (friends from my church) singing happy birthday, standing only a few feet away from me on my porch, not wearing masks. I said ""just a minute,"" went and put on my own mask, stood in my doorway and asked them if they could step back a bit. They did, but not very far, and then launched into the birthday song again. I was trying to be pleasant and calm while they sang and then stood around for 10 minutes talking to me...they were clearly trying to be kind and were pleased with themselves, and had left some gifts on my porch, but I was panicking inside the whole time. 

After they left, I shut the door and cried in frustration and anxiety. Part of my OCD is a lot of ""body-scanning"" for symptoms and worrying about them, but in the past few weeks I've been able to tell myself that ""the chances you have this virus are astronomically small."" Now it feels like I can't tell myself that to calm myself down. Yes, they're still small, but not astronomically small anymore. I realize it's strange to be so worried, and OCD and anxiety is a strange disorder. Any ideas on ways to shut down the worry about being exposed during that birthday visit?",2020-05-07 06:59:49

in the Decameron by 14th-century Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, a group of ten young women and men tell each other stories during isolation due to the black plague epidemic.

The protagonists of the Decameron find relief in collective storytelling, I thought of starting a project to encourage a parallel dynamic by converting the short stories by Boccaccio into small playable modules for the most recent version of Dungeons & Dragons.

Here is the link to the first adventure, based on the short story of Andreuccio da Perugia, [https://la-lieta-brigata.itch.io/eng-andreuccio-da-perugia-as-a-5e-adventure-quarantameron-ep1](https://la-lieta-brigata.itch.io/eng-andreuccio-da-perugia-as-a-5e-adventure-quarantameron-ep1)

I hope this can in some way help people organize digital game nights, I am sure there are many who would really benefit from something like that!

We are super close and very involved in each others lives. She's 58 and has a history of reacting pretty poorly to lung infections.

I'm freaking scared. I don't know what I would do if I lost her, I'm just not ready for that. She's a strong woman, just last year did a crazy mountain climbing journey that I don't think I could even do. But from what I can tell, people like her are still getting wiped out. We've all been taking Vitamin D since this started, so I hope that helps.

Honestly I don't even see how she hasn't been infected yet, with the stories she comes home with. I won't go into detail really since I don't think that's allowed. But the exposure is incredible and if this virus is truly as infectious as it seems to be, I can't even comprehend how she hasn't caught it yet.

Every day I have so much anxiety because I'm waiting for her to start coming down with it. When she goes to work I have a lot of anxiety because I'm worried she will catch it. And I know she is scared too, which makes me sad.

We both have asthma, but would both be classified as mild. Neither of us really ever use our inhalers. Hers used to be much worse than mine ever was, but now I think hers is a bit better than mine. For both of us it's just exercise that induces it, and it never progresses to asthma attacks. Nonetheless, I guess it counts as an underlying condition.

I find myself constantly trying to calculate her risk, and I know its just not possible to do that. I just have to hope really hard that if she catches it, it will be mild. I really hope that she has already caught it and was just asymptomatic. I really, really hope for that.

I'm also going back to work soon. I'm an essential employee but took a voluntary leave to try to protect my coworkers since my household has so much exposure. But I have to go back. I'm going to always wear a mask and try to be really careful because some of my coworkers live with their elderly parents with underlying conditions. I would stay away, but my work needs me to come back now and I don't want to lose my job.

Looking at the IFR, I feel like I shouldn't be so afraid. The chances are very good that if my mom gets it, she will be okay. But it just doesn't FEEL like that. It feels like if she gets it, she will die. I can't help but feel like that and be afraid.

Don't even ask about masks. Maybe 0.1% are wearing them. 

What is the fucking point of me even trying if people swarm around me like flies to shit? Reaching over me, brushing up against me, pushing by me in stores... 

I have resigned myself to the fact that I will very, VERY LIKELY contract Covid. Social distancing only works if people LET YOU distance. If you back up, but they come at you anyway, you can't do it. If they trap you in line, you can't do it. If they pass you on the isle, you can't do it. If they reach over you, around you, under you, you can't do it. Sure, I could say something. I'd be telling people to stay back every 3 feet. And some people just don't listen. 

But honestly, fuck me. I'm worried about my grandpa. He'll get it too because motherfuckers have no respect or intelligence. 

Here I am, I have been bending over backwards to stay back and safe. I haven't seen my fiance in weeks. My education is on hold (I have ONE EXAM LEFT) and I have hesitated getting a job because only public service jobs are available right now and I didn't want to bring Covid home to grandpa.  

I am seriously considering just giving up. If only one person is following the rules, how the actual hell could it make any difference? My grandpa is done trying to follow the rules, too. Our state is dumb as fuck. They set all these ""rules"" in place and then never enforced them even though they claim they did. They praised people for doing a good job social distancing when other states were making fun of us for being one of the worst states at social distancing. 

I can't even keep myself safe. How am I supposed to keep everyone else safe? It literally feels like a zombie hoard out there!!! No masks, no personal space AT ALL, and no safety. 

So, y'all tell me... If I'm literally the only one doing anything right... does it even matter at all? I'm so tired of killing myself when it feels like it doesn't matter at all. I am exhausted. I am stressed as fuck. I am scared. My world is suddenly scary. Mundane shit is stressful now. I don't want to lose my grandpa... But it's like others are hell-bent on taking him from me.

I have been working from home since mid-March. I am terrified of having to return to the office too soon. I am especially concerned since Gov. Newsom announced a transition to the first phase of re-opening tomorrow. I don't know when my county will make any changes to their stay-at-home policy. This is just ""phase 2"" and he says that ""phase 3"" that includes office workers who could work from home is months away. Still, I think every day about whether I will quit my job if we open sooner than I consider safe. It is a huge distraction. I have been at the company my entire career and moving would probably be a step back career-wise.

Today the new twist is that the office in which many of my team members work is apparently opening in three weeks. It is in a different country, so I don't know a lot about the local situation there. There is no word yet about what precautions will be in place. We got something general about mitigation from corporate, but nothing about how that will be applied locally. I suppose I will know more when the HR rep in that office sends the official notification.

My dilemma there is that I don't set the policy requiring people to come into the office, but I would not feel comfortable enforcing it on people who are afraid. I'm also not the direct supervisor of anyone in that office, I'm in-between their direct manager and those making the decision about the policy, so in theory I'm not directly involved in setting or enforcing the policy, unless something gets escalated to me. But I don't feel comfortable playing any role in forcing people to work if they feel unsafe. I feel I should be advocating for them. At the same time, if a large factory decided to re-open with unsafe working conditions, would I blame the individual foremen or shift supervisors? No, I would blame those at the top. It feels different when one of the people in that chain of command is me.",2020-05-06 22:26:59

It's a temp position that will likely end anyways, but even if got to stay on, I can't see myself doing that long-term without going nuts. Call center work is just not for me. I feel like I have to go back to my old job if I'm ever gonna reach my career goals (to build enough experience to start my own business and work from wherever I want).


However, I'm worried for my physical health going back to my original job, but if I don't go back now, when will I ever get to go back?  My boss has a plan in place with social distancing, Plexi glass in customer areas, and masks, so I hope with enough precautions we will be okay. Plus, I have my own office where I spend most of my time doing web/design work. I wish I could work from home with this position, but unfortunately the content of my work is tied heavily to the physical workplace/access to the products we sell. Trying to be vague for anonimity.


 Anyone else going back to work soon? How do you feel about all of this? 


Part of me is also worried about coming home to my SO after working (I plan to change clothes immediately and shower just to be safe), and being able to go visit my family (even from a distance). Up until this point, I had been going to their house to check on them, but staying outside talking with them from a distance while wearing a mask. Idk, I guess I'm just worried about it all. But I'm damned if I stay home, and damned if I don't. At least that's how it feels. Thanks for reading my rant.",2020-05-06 19:53:45
948,Classes to resume in-person in the fall. Should I risk it or take the semester off?,3,geomdi,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/geomdi/classes_to_resume_inperson_in_the_fall_should_i/,7,"So, I’m a nursing student getting my BSN. My school is planning to resume in-person classes this fall and I’m not sure if I should attend. Fall 2020 will be the start of my senior year and it is critically important. I moved to a new city at the beginning of this journey and we live in a cramped one bed, one bath apartment. My fiancé is immunocompromised and is a high-risk individual for COVID-19. 


Unfortunately, his grandmother passed away a couple of weeks ago. He was extremely close to her and his family is offering to let us live in her home rent-free (3 beds, 2 bathrooms, full basement and garage) if we want to move back home which is about 3 hours away. He really wants to go back as it will give us significantly more room and we’ll be closer to his family in case we need anything (no-contact, just like maybe a medicine drop off on the porch or groceries). I honestly want to go back too, as I am sick and tired of being trapped in this cramped apartment. 


I’m also terrified of being crammed with ~50 other students this fall in a tiny classroom and possibly having to deal with clinicals and being around patients without the guarantee of proper PPE (although our program still isn’t sure if we’ll be able to do clinicals yet or not). 


But this fall will be the start of my last year, God willing. And I’ve already had to postpone graduating by a semester due to being unsuccessful in one class at the beginning of my nursing education. I’m afraid if we move back home, I won’t continue with this or that I’ll feel like a failure for postponing graduation again. But I’m terrified of putting my fiancé at risk for contracting this. I’m his only in-person support for his illness at this time, and his primary caretaker as well when he’s experiencing flare-ups, so living separately isn’t really the best idea for what he needs. 


I’ve also been experiencing severe mental health issues since the start of this pandemic. It’s really affected my ability to study and just function as a human being. And nursing school is making it worse, to be honest. We’re dealing with finals this week, so I know it’s nearly over, but I know the fall will just bring the added stress back to my already heightened anxiety. 


I figured you all could relate to the overwhelming fear and anxiety that is being caused by COVID-19 and I’m hoping to get some insight from outside sources regarding this crossroad that I’m facing. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",2020-05-06 21:39:45

No matter what I do right in my life, I can rarely ever be rewarded. I understand others have it worse but I can’t stop feeling sorry for myself. I feel so alone and isolated. I remember being so anxious about this virus in January, it was all I read about. I got scared and took pre cautions, every sanitary measure. I thought if I’m not being ignorant about this virus and do my part, I will be okay. 

Last month my parents, mom 53 diabetic, dad with no conditions but 67 years, told me to take off work since I work with patients. It’s a pain center so no one comes in “sick”, just in physical pain. I got prescribed anxiety meds because of coronavirus scares alone. I told my coworker I was going to ask to take off, and got back lash from her because I was “too scared” to come into work (I was scared for my parents, it’s not a serious job). I took longer to ask time off bc I felt judged, and eventually got the virus the *week* that I requested. It seems more ironic that I’m the most worried about it so of fucking course I would get it over other people who don’t care. 

Then my worse fears came true, I gave it to my mom. I feel like it’s my fault if anything happens to them. Every day I wake up more anxious because I’m scared something will happen to both of them. I recovered with such a mild case and she’s around day 11, said she’s feeling better, no cough just fatigue. Now, I have to turn my efforts to helping my dad, who isn’t tested yet but most likely would’ve gotten it from us. He has no symptoms yet. I feel so isolated to tell my friends because they would just gossip about me and how I have the virus. I have become emotionally codependent to my significant other and feel helpless. 

I made a plan to turn my life around and apply for grad school before all of this. Every plans that I’ve made for myself has fallen through.  I wish it can all be over. I can’t take another day of planning worst case scenarios in my head. All I can ask is why? Why did it not make a difference how hard I tried to avoid this? Where did I fuck up? I don’t want to feel like I did this to my parents if anything happens to them, but I know I will. I haven’t been the luckiest person my whole life and this just made me feel much worse, like no matter what I do I will always get the short end of the stick because I’m *me*.  I ask myself why it can’t be one of those people who are constantly going out and are fearless? I just hope they will be okay. It hasn’t been 2 weeks since I’ve been recovered but I feel like I’m always waking up in a nightmare where my parents will get severe. 

Anyone out there who has any situation, mild or 
severe, I hope you’re fighting out there as well. It sucks and I hope we get through it in one peace, even if it means our mental health has seriously deteriorated. I still feel guilty that I’m bitching about this when others have had it worse.",2020-05-06 09:29:23

Monday he admitted he has a sore throat and his chest feels tight. The earliest he could get an appointment to be tested was today. He won't get the results until next week (or this Friday at the earliest if we're lucky 🤞).
My dilemma is I'd like to get tested too, so we can assess how we live our lives in our home - do we NEED to quarantine from each other because I'm not infected, or can we go back to being in close contact because I am infected?
Our daughter is nine months old and I'd like her to be tested for the same reasoning.
But it feels incredibly selfish to potentially ""take away"" those tests for someone else if by chance my husband is not infected with COVID19.
At the same time, not having my husband able to help with the baby is extremely taxing.
I can see pros and cons to both sides.
On another note, my husband went back to work to cashier on Tuesday and I'm incredibly mad at him for it.

She's never been overseas and was *so* excited to go--but we ultimately had to postpone it due to a major crisis. She works as a professional dog breeder, and a litter of her puppies contracted parvo. Funds we'd set aside for the trip were redirected to emergency vet bills. We planned to go in May of this year instead. 

I booked tickets and AirB&Bs. I planned tons of stuff for us to do. I sent her guidebooks and travel essentials for Mother's Day. My mom and I stayed up until late in the night sometimes just texting back and forth about cool stuff we were going to do. I've been living halfway across the country from my mom for 10 years now, and this was the first time I felt like we were really bonding as mother and daughter.

The important things are still true. My mom and I both have our health. And for the time being, we were able to get refunds on the AirB&Bs and credits for the flights. And I wouldn't trade the way we've connected over this trip for the world. But it's just kind of sad to think we could have been exploring Paris together today. She wasn't too upset about having to postpone, but I know she was disappointed. She admitted to me that she was starting to worry that we'd never get to go. I kind of worry about that too. My mom won't live forever, and now more than ever it's hard not to think about that. 

My mom is awesome. While I've been delving into freelance voice over work and other creative pursuits, she's been nothing but supportive and encouraging, and always quick to tell me she's proud of me. She sent me a bunch of face masks this week with cat prints on them because she knows I'm a total cat lady. When I was going through my divorce, living alone and just profoundly miserable, she hopped a plane up to Chicago to visit with me and give me the emotional support I needed. She's the best mom in the world and I'm so *lucky* to be her daughter. I really just was excited to be able to give her this.",2020-05-05 20:07:20

My question:  Is there any data on cases from people who have still been allegedly following basic precautions?  Are people following these precautions still getting sick in significant numbers?

For example:  are large numbers of people still getting sick, despite following social distancing/stay-at-home precautions, because they probably ""slipped up"" at some point on some bullshit like not immediately washing their hands after they opened up the bag of cookies they bought that morning?  Because they went to the grocery store once a week and somehow still inhaled droplets through their mask walking home?

My career trajectory, my prospects at a good future, my earning potential, my social life, my marriageability, all  functionally ended several years ago; what was left were several decades to slowly rot away.

Now the same seems to be happening to everyone on an apocalyptic global scale. More than 12 million people are unemployed in an event people are comparing to the literal Great Depression, except this time there's no FDR likely to make it into office. (I myself am furloughed from my admittedly shitty dead-end job.) All forms of human contact are essentially forbidden; unless you're lucky you are now indefinitely in Harlow's monkey experiment. Everyone's social and love lives are essentially frozen as they were on March whatever-it-was 2020, unless they've become freezer-burned since then. The fallout seems likely to be even worse. Businesses are closing, never to come back. Restaurants, small stores, venues, organizations, events, the travel industry in general, everything that made life worth living.

None of the standard advice applies anymore. ""Network! Go out and meet new people!"" Literally can't. ""See a therapist!"" None of them know what's going on either, obviously none of it is in person, and their advice amounts to ""Just make a bullet journal! :D"" Even if there were no stay-at-home orders, all the events are canceled. ""Apply for jobs!"" Sure, and compete with 12 million people and counting, many of whom are no longer geographically bound to an office. ""Just force yourself to go to that thing!"" There is no thing anymore. It's canceled. It's gone.

At this point I'm not afraid of the virus. In fact, I'd do anything to trade places with someone on a ventilator, whom I'm sure would rather be off it. It seems preferable to living through the remainder of life.",2020-05-05 22:17:06

While this is a new Reddit account, I have been a Reddit lurker since 2011 so I'm hoping that I get this right. I have been struggling through my COVID recovery and I've been feeling really lost, so I am hoping that talking it out with you all will help. Please excuse any formatting errors!

I was infected with COVID on March 26. My roommate (who is a bit of a conspiracy theorist) was having guests over to our house during lockdown and even recorded a Tiny Desk Concert submission with her band in our house while we were supposed to be quarantined. Her boyfriend, who believes that the virus is all in our heads and is caused by 5G, was the one who brought it over and even though neither he nor my roommate got sick, I did. 

It never got terrible for me, so I didn't go to the hospital. I just had a few nights where I was scared to sleep because my lungs were heavy and painful, and I was having very short breaths. However, during my recovery, I have had to take my comprehensive exams for grad school and I have had to complete an incredibly high-stakes project at work. I have been so stressed out trying to complete my last semester of grad school and not screw up at work, all the while dealing with lingering, painful symptoms, money issues (my side business as a DJ is dead during lockdown and I have been ordering so much food because I feel too weak to cook and I can't go anywhere to shop), and a roommate who believes that 5G caused this. She has been playing some kind of noisemaking device that emits a high-pitched tone that is supposedly keeping her room safe. 

My boss and I don't really get along either. She has been very hard on me through all of this, and didn't tell the office that I was sick (as I asked to to do) so everyone just thought I was taking vacation during this difficult project. When my COVID test came back negative, I went to my doctor and she told me that the test was likely taken too early and the cheek swabs can be inaccurate anyway. She diagnosed me because I have experienced literally all of the symptoms, but when I told my boss this she said, ""Well, it's not like your doctor is a COVID expert, so in the interest of not scaring people who were around you in the office, why don't you take vacation time instead of sick time, and we can say it's because you are preparing for your exams?"" She has since acted like I have been faking this whole thing. I feel like I am going crazy. 

Add to that, I haven't been able to see or hold or kiss my loved ones in over a month. I missed getting to celebrate my dad's, nephew's, and boyfriend's birthdays with them in April and I have been completely alone during recovery, aside from my roommate and her random guests (she has started keeping them on the porch now, but they are still coming into our house to use the restroom). 

Overall, I'm just feeling really vulnerable and trying to muster the motivation to heal. I'm scared of my lungs being permanently maimed by this and all I want to do is be kissed again and go sing karaoke with my friends and go for a long swim. I don't have the money to quit my job or move, and it's not like I can do either while I am sick. Today I set up appointments with a resume consultant and a therapist, and I made this account to see if writing it out can help at all. I appreciate you reading this far, and I'm sorry if it just came off like I am throwing a pity party for myself. There is no one else in my life dealing with COVID recovery so I figured I would give this a whirl as a healthy coping mechanism. 

Take care and stay safe!",2020-05-05 23:25:53

A friend and mentor I’ve known for years dropped the projects we were working on and I haven’t heard from him in more than a week.

Family hasn’t helped either. My parents are loving but emotionally neglectful, and never have empathy when I’m struggling with my mental health. I don’t feel comfortable talking to them about this stuff.

No school friends, no teachers, no supportive family to ask for help from or talk to, so I’m posting here. Any help would be really appreciated.",2020-05-05 06:18:01
970,I'm[29f] worried about my bf's[29m] anxiety over self-isolation during COVID19 and wonder how to help,3,gdvlqx,COVID19_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gdvlqx/im29f_worried_about_my_bfs29m_anxiety_over/,0,"So, hi! If you're reading this, I hope you're safe and sound.

Back  story: My bf and I are together for almost 4 years and we're working in  the same university campus. Our family and friends are in the same city  as the university. We both have rooms on site, so we're not living  together but we're very close to each other during weekdays. On saturdays he works and the rest of the weekend he usually rests. He sees  his friends and parents maybe once every 1-1.5 months. On the other  hand, I go visit my friends and parents on every weekend, unless some  emergency comes up. We usually spend time on weekday evenings and very  rarely on weekends. This is our usual life, for the past 3+ years. The  rooms on campus are in fact just small rooms (15 m2 with bathroom  included and common kitchen facilities that you share with a minimum of 8  other people), therefore not really comfortable for isolation  situations.

Due to COVID19, we're  told to work from home if/when we can (Most of the work we do is in a  laboratory setting). I spoke with my boss and went to my parent's home  about 6 weeks ago. My bf was going in to the office but was hoping to go  to his parent's house as quickly as possible. His parents are around 65ish, his father has hypertension, his mother has no chronical illnesses that I know. About 5.5 weeks ago, he  spoke with a person who was in contact (safe distance away, but still)  with a positive case (the person my bf talked with was in contact with a  positive case). Both my bf and that person showed no symptoms. My bf  decided he'll spend some quarantine time in rooms of the university.

Currently,  he's still at the university rooms and he's very anxious to go to his  parents'. He's telling me he's been using the common kitchens and  cooking and eating with others on his floor. He doesn't feel great,  can't sleep, has occasional slight fever, no coughing, no sneezing. He  tells me the time passes extremely slowly and most of the suggestions I  already made (""let's watch something!"" ""did you see this book?"" ""I'm  reading this, do you want a copy?"" ""look at this comic strip hehe"") were  shot down, saying he can't focus. He's been taking some vitamin C and  has slight sore throat, which is his usual allergies around April. He's  afraid he'll transmit something to his parents.

I  dropped by to his building last week, he was an emotional mess. We  write to each other everyday and I try to get him to talk to process his  emotions but he's not very talkative normally and this situation isn't  helping much. He emailed the university's psychological support center,  and was waiting for a response. I got him a friend's psychologist's  phone number in case he wants to talk somebody online.

What  can I do to make him feel comfortable, loved and safe? I feel if he  goes to his parents', things will be a little bit better but not fully  recovered. How should I help?

A little bit later, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/g7m028/my_incarcerated_dad_fell_ill_to_the_virus_hes_not/) with an update on his condition. He was suffering from kidney failure at that point, which was responded to with dialysis. At first, he responded well to it and appeared to be showing progress for a couple days.

However, earlier today I was informed that after all of the doctor's best efforts, they had determined he would no longer be able to be saved after suffering so much damage to his body and the doctors took him off the ventilator.

I don't even know what to think. I feel like I'm going insane.

Ever since he began his sentence, my dad made sure to call me all the time and we were always writing letters. He's turned me into the person I am today, from my beliefs, personality, and even my dreams in life. He was my best friend and supported me no matter what. His father and his step father were both shit, and he wanted me to have the father he wished he could have had. 

And now I've lost him for a second time. Even after all these years we patiently waited, stayed strong while we passed the time of his sentence, after we talked about all the things we were gonna do when he got out and how we were get him caught up with how things are out in the world. Even when his sentence was over in less than a year.

I wish I would've known the last phone call we had, when he was still healthy and we were talking on his birthday, was going to be our last. I wish knew it would've been my last 'love you' and 'goodbye.'",2020-05-04 10:34:58

As things are ramping up, I just feel like a mess. I have a final essay and the term ends tomorrow, this essay was due 2 weeks ago. I messaged my prof but it's barely finished and i've just accepted i can't pass my class because I spend every day in a nursing home that is short staff. it's only ever 3-6 hour shifts but they leave me so exhausted, the rest of my day is just filled with nothing. The patients yell at me as they are getting very discouraged, it's been months since they've been able to do as they wish. 3 have passed away, not of covid, but it is still hard to see. I'm watching and helping nurses put on the intense PPE as it's finally hit our area and we have to be so careful. It feels like a horror movie with the way we look. Sometimes I look and realise we're all in masks, the nurses in goggles and N95 gear on, it feels so dystopian. Despite that, the workers are still mean and I'm always yelled at for messing up, forgetting things like milk on the carts, but I can't just leave when they need me. The government promised an extra 4$ an hour but it hasn't arrived in our facility yet so I'm not making enough money to make it to the next term for school in the fall, much less the extra summer class I need to take now that I know i'm not passing the class with the overdue essay. it's been too long now, I am getting a zero on this assignment, I just know it. There's talk of me having to move into the retirement home I work in full time if things get worse. I was supposed to take a job at a museum that was full time for the summer. The hiring process was frozen though.

I don't know how to handle rent. I've always lived with my parents, and spent the first 2 terms of school on campus.  I paid 700$ as a deposit and was expecting to move into my first ever apartment this fall. Now my school likely won't be open and if I can't cancel my lease early I'm stuck paying for a home I won't be seeing until my 3rd year of school due to the way my program works with co-op.  I gained nearly all the weight I had been losing working on my dreams of being an entertainer during university. 2 months ago I was writing music, in the piano room, dancing, and studying with my friends. I was planning on how to decorate my first home and getting ready to meet my first ever roommates. Now i'm back at home and feel like a kid again, every day is exhausting, I feel like my mom doesn't get it bc it's just 3 hours shifts so she's frustrated i'm not finishing my essay. Then I feel even worse because I'm 19 and shouldn't still be mad at my mother for not ""getting"" me, I should be long past that. I just don't know how to tell my mom I can't bring myself to care about my schoolwork anymore, or even passing my final class. All I want to do is play animal crossing but I don't have the money for that. My old coping mechanism at university was to shop with my friends, but I can't even calm down with online shopping because no parcels are arriving, I have no money, and my friends all went back home. I'm not thinking of anything drastic by any means, I'm just so tired and I want the world to stop spinning for a few days so I can just catch up, finish my work, and take a nice bath or something. I feel near tears all the time.",2020-05-05 05:58:46

He ran Tonkatsu restaurant,which his grandfather-in law began.He seemed to have hope for re-opening.

Looking Japanese COVID-19 spreading,it's unlikely.Japan extended state of emergency.Local restaurants are not getting help.This man,same age to me,died.or committed suicide.

He was my neighbor business.I could do nothing.His restaurant's homepage which I saw only screen shot was carefully made,rice was chosen carefully to match Tomkatsu.He was proud restaurant owner.

I cannot order every meal from local business as I'm on fixed income.I'm surrounded by business in danger.(Who are not on ""fixed""income)I feel really really powerless while a man same age to me died,or choose to die.

i mean, it will realistically. even the black plague and the spanish flu ended. even though i've only been in quarantine since mid March, it's felt like years. people are saying that this virus probably won't pass in any meaningful way for another year or so, which is extremely depressing to hear but sounds accurate given the timetables. while i'm aware that i've lived many years of my life, i don't know how we as a society will cope, let alone my own individual self, with another year of disruptive social distancing.

i'm worried that even if we remove the lockdowns, even after COVID stops being a constantly-consuming threat to our society, we'll be too deeply traumatized to return to any sort of ""normal.""

i consider myself an extroverted person, but i really miss getting breakfast with friends, going to concerts, house parties, hearing about my friends traveling, walking in the big city, and even the simple act of sitting at a bench and just watching people go by. all of these little routines i miss so much and i'm worried we'll forever view them is horrendously unsafe. sure, i can catch up with my friends on ZOOM, or see some of my favorite concerts through streaming, but it feels like a constant reminder of our situation rather than a welcome distraction. i (sadly) assume that it will take a long time before i can partake in any of these rituals again, and even longer (or maybe never) before they'll feel natural and ""safe.""

even a temporary loss has been absolutely devastating to me, but the thought of these being viewed in a negative enough light for them to evaporate and be seen as relics of the past is breaking me. i support the lockdowns obviously but i see so many folks on reddit and twitter almost celebrating the death of public spaces and rituals. it's gonna suck ass to see the pivot of our society towards increasingly technocratic rituals and surveillance under the guise of safety. even formerly mundane rituals like going to the grocery store feel extremely dangerous and anxiety-provoking. sure, in the short term not going out in public is safe, but will the trauma of this pandemic forever turn us into hermits and hypochondriacs?

i suppose these concerns seem kinda stupid when we look at previous pandemics. we still had sex and intimacy after the devastation of HIV/AIDS (especially within the context of my queer ancestors). people celebrated in the streets even during the time of the spanish flu. but the world has changed so much since then. SARS and MERS seemed quaint compared to our current pandemic, but they left permanent marks on the way we operate and go about society everyday, especially in the areas it hit the most. i see so many technocrats and venture capitalists and whatnot spouting opinions such as that we should no longer have festivals and gatherings in the name of ""public health."" while i support not having these in our current situation, it's extremely crucial that we don't forget about our rituals pre-COVID, nor do we let the disease define our existence in this moment.

it's gonna be hard not living with these routines even in the ""short term"" (which is gonna feel so much longer than it actually is, no matter how long it'll take). honestly as negligent as they are, i can't even blame people for still wanting to go to church or hold parties just because it feels unfathomable to suddenly lose the ability to engage in one of humanity's basic traditions. obviously i don't support it, but i get the urge to do so myself, given that the pandemic still feels like an abstract concept to me and so many others. even past the strict social distancing measures, i worry that the small simple social routines will forever go away, and we'll live in an increasingly ""falsely-social"" world.

I hope this is the appropriate place to post this. Please let me know if otherwise.

My wife and I are living in the UK, and had a holiday to Switzerland booked for this June (June 1st - June 14th, booked over the space of Oct, Nov, and Dec last year) with several stays booked with Airbnb (amongst others, such as Booking.com).

Following the government advice to not travel unless absolutely necessary, we have been able to get a full refund for our Booking.com reservations, and some of our Airbnb reservations, however Airbnb are asking us for a government announcement ""telling"" citizens not to travel (not ""advising"") for a refund on the remaining bookings.

We've sent them the following link [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus), which they have rejected, saying that it is ""more travel advice"", however it clearly states ""Do not travel abroad unless it’s essential"".

Does anyone in the UK know of a government document announcing to UK citizens not to travel that we could pass on to Airbnb support? Or is this basically Airbnb's way of covering themselves legally, by not giving us a full refund?

Thanks so much for your help. We really appreciate it.",2020-05-04 15:24:42
